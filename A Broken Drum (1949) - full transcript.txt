No maid would stay in a home like that one. I've put up with it for three months. I may be a maid, not a scholar, but I am intelligent. How dare that arrogant man call this woman stupid? Could you stay calm after being called stupid? It is a violation of our basic human rights to make us work from 4:00 a.m. to midnight. In this day and age, who would work under such conditions? But the wife and daughters are nice people. Yes, that's true. But their kindness can't make up for the rudeness of the husband. I can't tolerate being treated so badly by that man. I'm leaving for good. Yes, I am. Chako, Chako. This is our good-bye. Let me see your belly. The little ones will be here before you know it. Don't you let anyone push you around just because you're a girl. - Good-bye, then. - Good-bye. Take care of yourself. Laundry boy! Farewell to you. - Are you leaving? - Yes. Any feminist would agree with me on this. I don't know. What do you mean? Look at the big house he bought. The 'nouveau riche' showing off his wealth. That man has bad taste in everything, yet he thinks he's great. I'll miss you. You have much better taste than him. I don't know about that. You're clueless, aren't you? No one will feed you secretly in our kitchen anymore. Don't be mean. I'm thinking about working at a cabaret. I'm sure you'll do just fine. Give me a ride to the station, will you? Look. There's the daughter. Oh, Miss Akiko. You're really leaving. I wanted to leave before your father comes home. It's okay. I understand. I wish you a happy marriage, and a happy life. Excuse me, then. Damn it! Laundry boy! She was a great maid. Yes, but no one stays with us long because my father can be so unbearable. That's not good. Men should be nice to women. All my maids seem to like me. My father always yells at them, which puts everybody ill at ease. He didn't order you to go on this date, did he? What if he did? It would still be an honor. Well, thank you for walking me home. I had a good time, but I shouldn't keep you. I don't mind. You know what? I'm thirsty. I'm sorry, but I can't offer you anything. If you'll excuse me. Good-bye. Come to the party tomorrow - Welcome back. - Good evening. This is for my mother. Mr. Hanada isn't with you? Give me a break. On the beach where I saw you last. There was a... It's Father's birthday, but no one's helping me. Shall I play my newest song? I have no time for that. Where's Akiko? In her room, I suppose. So many things to do. Life can't possibly be this exhausting. I don't know how much longer I can take it. "To be or not to be, that is the question." "Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them." Who cares? Just come help me. This is the essential part of the play. "To die, to sleep, no more." "And by a sleep to say we end." What's the next line? How tragic! - Mother! I need 20,000 yen. - You think I'm crazy? It's for a microscope for anatomy class. Ask your father. I would if I could. Will you ask him for me? I'll ask him if you fry the cutlets for me. Okay! That's why I love you! Why didn't you invite Mr. Hanada into the house? Mother. How did you feel about getting married? How did you feel? I didn't have the luxury of considering my own feelings. I wasn't happy at all. I was crying on my wedding day. My makeup was totally ruined. But you still married Father. I just accepted it as my fate, I guess. Sometimes you make the defining decision of your life without strong convictions. Did you two get along well? He thinks so, but I can't say for sure. What about me? What about you? "I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry." "Be thou as chaste as ice, pure as snow, thou shall not escape calumny." "Get thee to a nunnery." "Go, farewell." I don't want to get married. I don't even like that man. I shouldn't marry him if I feel like this. He may not be perfect, but your father is eager for this arrangement. Tell me, Mother. What do you really think about this? If you marry Teruo, your father will be happy. But I can't force you to marry him if you don't want to. You aren't formally engaged to him, so it's not too late to call it off. Except that your father will be angry. "Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool." Haruko! Enough with that! Maybe we should talk to your father when he's in a good mood. Come help me in the kitchen. This on top of the microscope... "To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell." - To the kitchen, not a nunnery. - Yes. Don't they teach anything useful in school? For girls, learning how to cook is more important than acting. Will you stop it? You're giving me a headache. I need to buy more staff paper. Don't be fancy. Just write it down in a notebook. I'm home. Hi there. Where's your father? Mother. I need to talk to you before he comes home. - I'm busy. - It won't take long. - What do you want? - Please sit down. Heiji, you listen, too. - I can't give you money. - It's not that. Well, I want to quit working for Father. Not again. This time, I'm serious. Stop tormenting me, would you? Tormenting you? I just want your advice. Mother. Welcome home, Brother. What shall I do in the kitchen? "Get thee to a nunnery and find out." I see. "Farewell." Quit and then what? Aunt Motoko and I will start a joint venture. Mother. We want to expand her music box company. Everything is set to go. We can start operation in a few days. All we need is a little more capital. - Just as I thought, it's about money. - Calm down. No time to calm down. He'll be home any minute. Mother. Did I make enough cutlets? You didn't have to bring them into the living room. We should eat them while they're hot. Yes, let's eat. - It's not your birthday. - True. - Put that on the dining table. - Okay. Mother. The future of Father's company is not so rosy. Sooner or later, his business will go bust. It's for the best if I go into a different line now. Watch what you say! It's his birthday! Anyway, about that capital, Aunt Motoko has managed to keep the operation modest, but we need at least two million yen for mass production. You must be joking! Mother! - Akiko, help us in the kitchen. - I'm not done. Curry rice and some croquettes. What's going on? - Is everything ready? - How are these meatballs? Are these for playing catch? I'm not asking for two million yen. Just half that. It's still a lot of money. I'd hesitate to give even 20,000 yen. Don't be stingy. That's right. I'm not a child anymore Let me do my own thing. What's wrong with helping your father? What are you talking about? He wants to get yelled at by your father. He can yell all he wants. I'm serious about this. - That's the spirit! - Stop encouraging him. Don't forget about me. I know, I know. All these will make great birthday gifts. Mother! This will be interesting. Interesting? I'm all shook up. We should defy our father once in a while. If he was that easy, the last 30 years would have been a breeze. I'm home. I'm starving, too. You and everybody else. Don't you need my help? - "Get thee to a nunnery!" - Haruko! Oh, how did you give birth to all of us sinful children? I think I turned out okay, but still you shouldn't have had me. With all the noise, you'll turn me into Hamlet. Father's back. Welcome home. Kill that barking dog. Yes, sir. Do you care to explain how you'll kill our neighbor's dog? Don't say such things lightly. Yes. There's a spider web. Yes. - Haruko, take care of it. - Yes, sir. Taro, why did you leave work early today? - Well. - Well what? Employees can't leave before I do. You idiot. Stop being cranky. It's your birthday, after all. I almost forgot. Everyone go water the garden! Yes, sir. I'll go easy on them tonight. It's not even summer. - Everyone's got a drink? - Yes. - Happy birthday to me. - Happy birthday. That tastes good. - Kuniko, go ahead. - Yes. - You too, Taro. - Yes, sir. Heiji, not you. You shouldn't drink. You must earn money before you can drink. Yes. I'll drink soda. Anyway, how great it is to be able to have supper like this. Right, Kuniko? Sure. I hope you children know how lucky you are. Yes. Taro, how old are you now? I'm 30. 30? So, you're an adult now. You should be working much harder then. When I was your age, I had a hundred men working for me at a lumber camp in Hokkaido. I was full of energy. Ever since I was a kid, I've learned how hard life can be. My motto has stayed the same. Life is money. I decided to roll the dice on the frontier land of Hokkaido. Both Taro and Heiji were just babies when we left the mainland. Those days were a blast. Right, Kuniko? For me, it was hell. One must be courageous to succeed. That's right. - Father. - What? Allow me. Fill it to the brim. Serve the curry rice to the young ones. Yes, sir. - Heiji, how old are you? - I'm 28. Twenty-eight, huh? I was that age when I married your mother. You were such a pretty girl. Stop it. You're 28, playing the piano, not even making a living. Please, not today. He must have gotten that from you. You used to play the organ. I liked it when you played. Akiko, how old are you now? I'm 24. Your mother was six years younger when she married me. Had two babies in a row, then off to Hokkaido. Compared to hers, your marriage is much more luxurious. He has money. He has social status. Everything a girl could want. Taro. You should think about getting married yourself. Have a few kids, then you'll appreciate what I've done for you. Oh, this curry rice has a nice color to it. - Haruko, Shiro, have some more. - Yes. - You can't succeed on an empty stomach. - Yes. Lots to be thankful for. TSUDA CONSTRUCTION CO. This may take a while. Go ahead and sit down. GIVE IT YOUR ALL Back then, my only pleasure... was to eat a simple dish of curry rice. I slaved away day in and day out just so I could eat that curry rice. As a man who has endured a hard life, I sympathize with your current situation. As the company's president, I'd like to make life better for all of you. After all, I consider myself to be a father figure to you all. However, as you may know, we're up against the cold wind of the current economic climate. The price of supplies has risen, and it's getting harder to secure them. Please understand that our company is hardly alone. The whole industry is suffering. Projects languish and remain uncompleted. We, too, have one such project on our hands. Right before its completion, our funds ran dry. For us to successfully complete the project as planned, I must ask all of you for your patience and devotion. The company needs you as much as you need the company. In the same way, parents need their children and children need their parents. I steadfastly adhere to the view of life that I've just laid out, which has allowed me to survive many hardships in life. I ask you to trust me, Gunpei Tsuda, like a father, to devote yourselves to the completion of our current construction project. I'll definitely tell him today. You say that everyday. Construction isn't for me. What a beautiful sky. I don't want to marry him. Father is expecting a dowry from him. That's exactly why Father doesn't care how I feel. His business is down right now. And we all depend on his business for our standard of living. Taro, Taro. Yes! Yes? Father? Akiko. Ready? Shall we go? Too bad. You just missed a great speech. Right? I was pretty good, wasn't I? Yes. You should learn how to do it. Hello, Miss. Hello. Sir I'm going to the bank. Do you need anything else? I'll be at the Hanadas'. Call me there with the results. Yes, sir. Don't leave there empty-handed. Yes. Wait. Your tie is crooked. Okay, I'll leave you in charge. Let's go. Listen, Father. Did Mother talk to you last night? - What about? - Oh, nothing. - Then, don't bother me. - Yes. He's so intimidating! Akiko! Don't stay near the door. Come over here. Okay. Excuse us. Sorry. Excuse us. Sorry. Man, why does it get so crowded? It's stuffy in here. Shall we open up the windows? Let's do it. Yes, let's open them all. Do you mind sliding down a little? I'd say it was because of the train. It's the driver's fault. I'm so sorry. I may have torn the hole, but it was the driver's fault. Passengers fall down when he slams on the brakes like that. I'm not accusing anybody. But you could apologize for actually tearing the hole. I do feel sorry, but I won't apologize for something that's not my fault. Father, please. Excuse me? You shouldn't have brought it on such a crowded train to begin with. You should be more cautious. What I bring with me is none of your business. Then if it's broken, that's none of my business. We're really sorry. Don't you have any decency? You're persistent, aren't you? If this is about your painting, let me just buy it. This is idiotic. You calling me an idiot? What a punk. The sound of a broken drum. Oh, so sad. The festival in the woods. Oh, so merry. "Where's your father?" You have to say it louder. This is embarrassing. No one's watching. - "Where's your father?" - "At home, my lord." "Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house." "Farewell." Mother! - Mother, this is wild! - What is it? Take a look at this. This is amazing. See those tiny lumps? Those are eggs. - Is this mine? - It's Father's. Oh, my. - What are you looking at? - Feces. Damn it! I'm drinking right here! Is he drunk? He should stop drinking, anyway. Father would be furious if he saw him drinking... Father's got no empathy. The sound of a broken drum. Oh, so sad. He's got a sample music box from Aunt Motoko. He says he'll break the news to Father tonight, and if Father doesn't agree, he'll cut his ties with Father. Sounds scary. I'll go to my room. He's home. Welcome home. - Welcome home. - Thank you. The date for the engagement ceremony is set. So, you're really marrying that guy. "Frailty, thy name is woman." Tyranny, thy name is Fatherl Oh, shoot! So, that's what cost me 20,000 yen? Let me see it. Is there something to look at? Eggs. Can you see them? It's kind of beautiful. Beautiful? This is very interesting. Something's moving. Take a look. I've seen quite enough. So, what is this? - It's yours. - Huh? Only yours had eggs. What? Pretty cool, right? - Idiot! Sorry! You put that on the dining table? But it's yours. You knowingly let him do this? Only my stool had worms? It just happened to be yours. Get me some anthelmintics. I'll get some from the doctor's office tomorrow. Matasaburo must have some. Mr. Stool Examiner. He's only a student, still being incubated as a doctor. Enough with the egg references! Who's been drinking my whiskey? Get Taro in here, right now! What's he doing? It's only whiskey, honey. He drank the best one. Can you wipe down the dining table? Yes, ma'am. He didn't even greet me. Your bath is ready. Welcome home, sir. This is our new maid, Miss Kimi. How do you do, sir? We like things to be neat and clean. Make sure you keep it that way. We follow strict manners, and so will you. - Oh, it's all in vain. - That man is a broken drum. Taro! Where are you? Where are you hiding? - Where is he? - We don't know. Idiots! Didn't you notice when I got home? The bank won't give us the loan. You should be out looking for a loan, not sipping whiskey. My company is your company. You should show more enthusiasm. Tomorrow morning, go to the bank and secure a loan. You want me to slap you? Bring my whiskey. - What about a bath? - Not tonight. They think they're smarter than me. Father. I need to speak with you. Not now. I'm in a bad mood. I'd like to make music boxes with Aunt Motoko. - What? - Taro, now isn't the time. Be quiet! Construction isn't really for me. I want to do something I like. Shut up! Our company won't bend to your needs. Deal with it. You want to make toys? Making toys is for old ladies. It's not a man's job. It's a legitimate business. Are you talking back to me? No, I am not. Branching out can't hurt us in case you go bankrupt... - Watch your mouth! - Please! It's fine. I'm accustomed to this. What do you mean by that? How dare you speak to your father like that! Taro. Go apologize to your father. Sorry. I'll go stay with Aunt Motoko. But you don't have any money. I won't ask for his help anymore. I'll do it myself. Right now, you're just emotional. Mother. Kuniko. I'll take my bath. Yes! Whatever you say. Mother, please don't think I'm being silly. I'm the firstborn, and if I keep doing his bidding, it's not'good for my brothers and sisters. I'll work my hardest to make it. But don't misunderstand him. Your father cares about all of you. Perhaps in his own way. The way he shows it satisfies no one but him. But you want us to be really happy, right? Thank you. Please keep this. I'm going to leave this house. Take care of Mother and Father. Especially Mother. It's been tough for her. And... don't let him get you down. He's on his own path now. I wrote a song about Father. Want to hear it? Who threw away this big drum? A grumpy father thunders away. Now the little birds are frightened. And the startled fawns leap away. All the insects have been awakened. Everybody is terrified now. SHIGEKI NONAKA 2580 KUGENUMA How's everything, Mr Big Drum? If you keep it up so loud soon you'll be exhausted. Now see what you've done to yourself. You're now one broken drum. Somebody wash my back! Yes. Well. - So? - It's great. Matasaburo! Come to the bathroom! Kimi has fainted. What happened? She's epileptic. She was just washing his back. Come on! Do something! That part should sound a little more tender. We want the atmosphere of Montmartre in the fog. I forgot "the fog" part. How can you forget? We first met on a foggy night in the Bois de Boulogne. Let me try again. Excuse me. Honey. Excuse me. I've got heartburn. It's two beautiful young ladies. Who are they? They came to see Shigeki. Really? How lovely you both are. Please come in. Come wait inside. He'll be back soon. We don't want to bother you. It's no bother. We came to return this to him. He's such a forgetful boy. Thank you so much. Now please come inside. Honey! Honey, Shigeki is quite a ladies' man. He's not a child anymore. He's a 28-year-old man, enjoying his youth. I must make tea for them. I'll do it. Make it a little sweeter for them. Sorry to keep you waiting. Look at the damage done to this paining. He was going to enter an exhibition with this. There are some horrible people out there. A man tore the painting on the train and blamed my son. Please sit down. Thank you. Make yourselves at home. This is one of his better pieces. He was upset. He must be walking it off. Sister, maybe we should leave. Please don't rush. I'm sure he'll be happy to see you. - So he didn't enter the exhibition? - All because of that nasty man. My son says he was dressed like a "nouveau riche." We just wanted to return this. Please. You don't have to rush off, do you? I'm sure he'll cheer up when he sees you two. Shigeki gets his divine inspiration from beauty of this world. But now, his soul is scarred by that ugly and evil man. Only things of beauty can heal his wounds. The evil left a disgusting mark on this, and his father and I aren't able to erase it. He hired the model with the money he made from illustration jobs. Actually... Tea is ready. Let's have tea, shall we? You really don't have to. You know, come to think of it, Shigeki is 29. Is he? I'm the one with the digit eight. You're home. Look what I got. That's a beautiful bouquet. Don't be shy, Shigeki. Come here. Okay. I want to apologize for my father's behavior. I'm truly sorry. I envy you for having such great parents. They're still in love just like when they met in Paris. That's great. My mother was sketching in the Bois de Boulogne. Then she suddenly heard a violin. She was captivated by the sound of it. That's how they met. How romantic. My father was studying music there and became a fulltime violin player for her. Even now, he plays for her whenever she paints. And she only paints scenes of Paris. That's why we're always broke. But we're always happy. I have a favor to ask. Will you paint it again with me as the model? I think he just found his muse. With a great build like yours, anything would look good on you. - You think so? - Sure. Double-breasted suits look best on confident men like yourself. Not bad, huh? Like a British gentleman. Great. Can we borrow your mirror? I only have a compact mirror. I need one that's much bigger. In the bathroom, sir. I know that. KEEP THE BATHROOM CLEAN The rain pours down like the tears of the harbor. Your love consumes me like sweet liqueur. Who is that? Who's singing in the toilet? Get out here now! Yes. Have you been scribbling on the toilet walls? No, not me. Come on. Wash your hands. Right. You're like a child. Bring that box here. Boss. I went to all the banks in town, but unfortunately, no one... Will give us a loan? One bank sent a loan officer to our site. He thinks the project is too big for our company. Did you show them the estimates? Yes. There's nothing wrong with our numbers. They're looking to invest in something more secure. Are you saying we're not secure? No, I didn't mean that. You need to have faith in us. You have to have strong determination. I'll try one more time. Not just once. Try as many times as it takes. How often do you need to go? I forgot my abacus. That's filthy. That's really filthy. You should have your stool examined, too. You look like you've got worms inside. Yes. It's been a long time. What can I do for you? I need to talk to you. Thanks. Put a rush on it. Of course, sir. I wanted to talk to you about Taro. He's not my concern anymore. He can do as he pleases. But... your firstborn wants to start his own business, and maybe you could help him by investing in it. I'm the one who needs help. He's ungrateful for what I've done as a parent. And your son's fitting is ready. When should I bring it? You should ask her. After it's paid, I'll send him to your store. I won't pay. Come on. You can give him a suit or two. Well, I'll let you know. Thank you. Thank you very much. Who do you think you are? We need two million yen. You gotta be kidding me. I do know that your business is not doing well. That's none of your concern. You can't give us that much money. You got that right. But not as an investment. Can you give it to him as your heir? Is it what you want or what Taro wants? We both do. What a nerve! We're partners in this venture. We help each other. Then lean on each other, not me. But we wouldn't decline your fatherly love for him. God is love, and love is everything. Be generous to all. Especially to your own. How much do you want? I am not a beggar. Hello, there. Oh, hello. I'm glad you came. I'm lad. You should seek advice from God as to what you should do! She sounds angry. Lots of oddballs come to see me. I've brought you this. Why, thank you. THE AMOUNT OF TWO MILLION YEN The rest will be paid after the engagement. Thank you. Let's just relax now. Coming. Yes, sir? Coffee, please. The good stuff. Right away. I've been calling your house, but Akiko's never home. You know how it is. A bride-to-be has a lot to do. Then I shouldn't worry. She doesn't hate me, does she? Of course not. That's ridiculous. Tell your employees to knock before entering the bathroom. The two of them barged right in! The sound of a broken drum. Oh, so sad. The festival in the woods. Oh, so merry- A grumpy father thunders away. The raccoons beat their bellies like drums. The owls hoot, one too many times. And we all dance until the morning breaks. I want to hear something soft. How about a waltz? Which arm? Either one. Just don't hurt me like yesterday. Is something wrong? No. He's using me to practice injections. That's not true. I'm his guinea pig. This is to ease your fatigue. Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, the glass slipper was found by him. She was the one in the pumpkin carriage. Oh, Cinderella, how beautiful you are. - Shall we dance? - What? I can't. - Let's dance, Shiro. - No way! Dance with me! Shall we? You're making me blush. In a lovely garden under the full moon, She sang as she took her last breath. The blood on the chest of the Nightingale Turned all the roses crimson red. You must have gotten some new energy. Let's dance. I can't dance. Taro taught you, didn't he? - Go ahead, ma'am. - Stop it. - The waltz is easy. - Okay, then. - We left the kettle on, right? - Yes. I'll go. I don't want you to faint again. Your mother is a happy woman. How so? She's blessed with such loving children. Only when my father's not around. When will he be back? In a week, I hope. He's gone for that long? No, he'll be back tomorrow. Darn it! When he's not here, I feel taller. I feel more romantic. Too bad I'm dancing with you. My father is not a bad person. His family was poor, so all they did was work. He doesn't know how to show love. I wonder if he feels lonely. He's a man of self-confidence, not the type for self-reflection. He's not attentive to the feelings of others. Are you all right? I'm fine. This is almost paradise. Good evening, everyone. Is that you, Urne? It's been a long time. I happened to be in the area, and wanted to say hi. You've become successful, right? Oh, not too much. These are nothing. Good-bye. Can I send you off at Yokohama station? - What about your family? - They won't mind. One ticket to Yokohama. "Tarzan and Cheetah crossed the river and started running." "They sometimes swung from tree to tree." "Together, they overcame all the hardships they faced." "When they came to the edge of the cliff, the courageous Tarzan jumped down to the bottom of the valley." Let's get off. - It's so beautiful. - Very. Everything I see is just beautiful. I wish this could last forever. Everything is infinite. Everything is infinite and there's no end to it. Shall we climb up? You, kids. What are you doing? We want to gaze at the beautiful stars. No funny business. Is it okay? No jumping off, either. We just want to go up there. No jumping off. The etiquette is the man should go up first. Really? That's Cassiopeia. I know a little, too. Above it is Pegasus. To the right is Andromeda. What's that bright red star below? I don't know. It's Aldebaran. Many western artists have depicted the story of Taurus. It's about the abduction of Europa. How does it go? Once upon a time, the god Jupiter was in love with the goddess Europa. One evening, she was at the beach collecting shells. Jupiter came along disguised as a bull, and invited her to ride on his back. As soon as she climbed on, the bull seized the opportunity and galloped away into the ocean. In that bright red star burns man's eternal passion for woman. Akiko. If I were that star, would you climb onto my back? Shigeki, I'll go wherever you want to take me. Akiko. I thought he would be back later. Now I can't practice for the play. - He's a sadist. - Listen to his snoring. And the size of his head. You yell from dusk till dawn. We're used to it, not afraid anymore. How's everything, Mr. Big Drum? If you keep it up so loud soon you'll be exhausted. Now see what you've done to yourself. You're now one broken drum. Hey! I'm not your toy to play with. Go to the garden and water the plants. Yes. I'm so tired from the trip. Look at that beautiful blue sky. It's perfect for airing out the bedding. Can't you relax a little bit? A man must keep working, or he becomes lazy. I've done my share of work. Come on. We have a long life left. You drive me nuts. Oh, no. It's Sunday and you make them do chores. It's for their own good. Adversity makes a man wise. I'm living proof of it. My parents died when I was a kid, I had to support myself working as a day laborer. Then don't you want to give them what you didn't have? I have. I've given them a bourgeois life. You should be grateful, too. How could I be? You enslave me with your whims. You don't even take me to hot springs. Be patient. Soon, I will buy the neighboring homes and build you a big garden. You'll be able to enjoy the grand view, no need to travel to hot springs. As if I believed you. - I'm going out. - See you later. - Where to? - Shopping. I hear that you go out everyday. A woman her age has places to go. You'll stay home today. Teruo will be here later. I don't want to see him. Akiko. Are you going to disobey my orders? Wait! Don't you dare! Just listen to what she has to say. Come back here. I have something to tell you. This is your fault! You never discipline them. I apologize for my shortcomings. But will you please listen? Mother! Go to your room, dear. You're grounded. Think about your behavior. Get to the point. The truth is... Akiko really doesn't want to marry Mr. Hanada. You'll understand if you really listen to her. What's your point? She'd like to call off the engagement. - We can't do that. - It's not official yet. Stop it. Are you out of your mind? But... I, too, ask you to call it off. What about my business? We can't make her suffer for it. To whom do you owe this comfortable life! All the luxuries of life! Just how do you think we can take care of six children? I'll have to endow each one of them. I want them to have a respectable social status. In this harsh world we live in, who else will look after them? Who else will look after them like I do? You kids, too. Listen! Yes, sir. Taro, that idiot, is gone. He doesn't understand how deeply I care for him. He took all I gave him for granted! And now, at this most critical time for my business, Akiko is only thinking of herself. - I've had enough! - Wait! You will marry Mr. Hanada. Don't even think otherwise. Understood? Answer me! Please keep it down. Mr. Hanada is at the door. Go out with him. Just keep smiling. If you don't, you're in trouble. - Where are you going? - Isn't it clear? I'm going out with Teruo now. Let's go. Hello! I'll see you later. This is for the best. Don't say anything to confuse her. She's just being emotional about leaving this house. She doesn't know anything about the world. As parents, we want to make sure she marries a wealthy man. Even if she doesn't like him now, his wealth will make her happy. Remember that. Sir, there's a call from your office. No wonder you're getting gray hair. What? They're refusing to work? You make them work. What? The money? Tell them I'll pay them today. But make them work a double-shift. What? Make them, you idiot! I can't marry you. Huh? As a man, you must have reservations about marrying a woman forced on you. Not really. My father wouldn't approve of this, but I've decided. Good-bye. Liar! To Kugenuma, please. Is something wrong? You look worried. I ran away from home. What? I'll stay with Aunt Motoko. Then what? I'll do whatever it takes to marry you. The tea is delicious. My mom adds real sugar for you and me, usually she uses saccharine. But they still enjoy their tea. I wish to share such happiness with you. The true happiness of family. Honey. Until now, whenever I closed my eyes, all I'd think about was Paris. But these days, all I think about is Shigeki and Akiko's happiness. Where are you hiding Akiko? Why can't you tell me? I didn't know what to say to Hanada. She refused to marry him, now they're refusing to invest. You knew that would jeopardize my business, didn't you? It's your mistake. It's not Akiko's fault. It doesn't matter. Where is Akiko? You must know! - She went to Kugenuma. - Kugenuma? What for? Actually, you gave her the reason. She's modeling for the painter you crossed paths with on the train. By whose permission? Mine. To make amends on your behalf. Idiot! You let an engaged woman go see that punk? Didn't you think something might happen? I've put up with you for longer than I should have. With your affairs with second-class geishas and bar hostesses. I bore the pain silently. In the past 30 years, I've never rested. I've always served your needs. As wives should. Nothing to brag about. I'm not bragging. But the children and I have a right to be happy. I won't let you rule over us anymore. Well said! - Have you forgotten the feel of my fist? - Of course not. Every time you beat me, I regretted marrying you. Father! Please don't hurt her! Stay out of this! If you resort to violence, I'll leave you. Taro's business is taking shape, slowly but surely. I want to be there to show my support. Hold on! I don't care where t ou go, but you'll get nothing from me. Taro will take care of me. Just transfer back the title of that little property that I gave you. It's gone. I gave it to Motoko to put up capital. You what? I was counting on that money. Father! Ungrateful bunch! Father, please! Shut up! You want me to go bankrupt? You're the one that dropped the ball. Leave us out of it. - How dare you say that! - Don't hurt her! Let go of me! Get me some water. What's that for? You know what? You really are a broken drum. You beat your loved ones, but what does it do? You don't hear a sound that we make. All you do is to shout out of key. What do you mean? One day, you'll notice the empty sound of your drum. When you do, I'll come back. Don't bother. I'll find another wife You can all leave if you want. I will. Mother, I'm coming with you. Yeah, go ahead. What about you two? I'm still thinking. If you go, leave the microscope. I'd love to take you with me, but I can't. You have school, and if we left him all alone, it would be so pitiful for him. I know it's hard on you, but what else can we do? He's not going to change his ways. But now you have a chance to live peacefully. I've thought about leaving him countless times. But when I thought about you, I couldn't go through with it. Now that you're all grown up, I hope you can be happy for me and send me off. Don't you worry about us. You're too kind, considering how he always picked on you. You can always come see me. Stop crying. Okay, go on. Mother, do you need help? Yes, tie up that bundle. You can send the rest. I'll come for a daily injection. You've always been my little boy, the most affectionate of all. When I become a doctor, I'll take care of you. I'll look forward to that. Stop crying and walk me to the station. If it's so sad, you can leave too! Sure. Don't mind if I do! How disloyal! Kimi! Oh, no! Kimi! Quick! Come help! Now! It's an emergency. Come home soon. I hope so, too. Take care. On the beach where I saw you last... "Where is your father?" "At home, my lord." "Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house." "Farewell." "O, help him, you sweet heavens!" "If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry." "Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny." "Get thee to a nunnery, go." "Farewell." "Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool." "For wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them." "To a nunnery, go." "Quickly, too." "Farewell." Mother, will you come with me? I just drove by Father's office. The company's sign was gone. What? Exactly as I predicted. I've been gone for two weeks and he's lost his business? What shall we do? He doesn't show it, but he must be down. Maybe I should come home. He might get violent with you. True. He's not the type to concede. Welcome back, sir. Welcome home. - Hello. - Welcome. The neighbor's dog had pups, didn't she? Yes, six puppies. Same as me. This way. Thanks for everything. Thank you for your hard work, as well. You've looked after me all these years. No regrets. We did everything we could. It depends on how you look at it. Even if we had held on to the project, our funds would have run short. Worst case, they sue us for breach of contract. That project is now Tanaka Construction's problem. Their president is a whale, with no brain. You managed to keep this house. It was wise of you, sir. Stop calling me that. I'm going to start over from scratch. This is nothing. I have several big projects under my belt from my Hokkaido days. Indeed, you do. If you stay determined, then you can do anything. That's my motto. If you'll excuse me, I must go now. Take care of yourself. You too, sir. Sir, I must thank you for your kindness. You're going home? Yes. I've collapsed too many times, and it's too much of a trouble to you. I was just getting used to it. But every time I faint, I break things. You're ill. It's not your intention. Oh, sir. You're being uncharacteristically kind, making it hard for me to leave. Then, don't leave. But I'm not the type to reconsider a decision I've made. Being stubborn isn't always good. When you know you've made a mistake, correct it right away. I'll talk to my brother, sir. Don't water during the day. It will just dry out. You should just play the piano. Play a song for me. Yes. We made curry rice. Would you like some? Curry rice, huh? - Sure. I'd love some. - Right away. Father, what shall I play? - Something joyful. - Okay. Play the one that you all used to sing together. Something about a broken drum? It's about me, right? Yes. I'm sorry. Don't apologize thoughtlessly. It's time I listened to that song. Well, here goes. Who threw away this big drum? A grumpy father thunders away. Now the little birds are frightened. And the startled fawns leap away. All the insects have been awakened. Everybody is terrified now. You yell from dusk till dawn. TAKASAKI - 24 MILES We're used to it, not afraid anymore. How's everything, Mr. Big Drum? If you keep it up so loud soon you'll be exhausted. Now see what you've done to yourself. You 're now one broken drum. The sound of a broken drum. Oh, so sad. The festival in the woods. Oh, so merry. Grumpy father is... All the insects have been awakened. Everybody is terrified now. The sound of a broken drum. Oh, so sad. The festival in the woods. Oh, so merry. A grumpy father thunders away. The raccoons beat their bellies like drums. The owls hoot, one too many times. And we all dance until the morning breaks. You yell from dusk till dawn. We're used to it, not afraid anymore. You're now one broken drum. You all drove me to bankruptcy! That company was my life's work, and you crushed it. You may think I'm a tyrant, but I've worked hard to get where I am. I care more about you than you know. If I'm a bit stubborn and forceful, that's because I'm concerned for you. My life has been nothing but tough. Yes, I've hit you kids and your mother. But I was beaten by others far worse than you can imagine. And now my family has turned on me. You call me a villain, and kick me around then proudly leave me. Heiji, who do you think is wrong? No one is wrong. What? We are lonely creatures. Despite our family ties, we are all individuals. We all lead our own lives. Family ties mean nothing, then? Of course they do. A family is a family. With that strong connection, must come deep trust and independence. And that's how we keep our love for each other. I'm scared of you, but at the same time, I love you. You must be frustrated with me for not earning anything, but I think you kind of love me, too. Fool! What parent "kind of' loves their kids? I love my kids more than anything. No need to get angry, then. Life is most miserable when there's no one to love. You have six of us. If you give your love to one a day, you're busy until Saturday. On Sundays, you can spend time with Mother, and talk about the old days. An accomplished man like you should have much more fun in retirement. Don't be depressed about your business. You've done everything. You should be proud. Yes, I've done all I could. "No regrets for my youth." "A hero knows who he is." Words by Napoleon on St. Helena. Yes. I know who I am. I can see why your mother is angry at me. Mr. Broken Drum is strange today. I felt bad for trying to leave him. You should stay, Sister. You can keep feeding me in the kitchen. - Okay, I'll stay. - All right. My goodness! Hello! Sir, Taro is here. - Welcome back, sir. - Hi there. It's been a while. Father, how have you been? What do you want? Well. I... came to pick up this music box. Oh, no. Did you step on it? Our business is booming, we can't leave even one collecting dust. Foreign buyers love them too. We just got an export contract. You came to brag? Not at all. To be honest, none of us have any experience running a business, so if you could give us some advice... As expected! What do you guys know about business? Mother always says if you were there, it would be a piece of cake. She's right. What do you say? Aunt Motoko keeps telling me: "Love thy enemy." What kind of problem do you have? Balancing profits against expenses. We can't even tell if we're making money or losing it. You fool. You need to face more hardships in business. Right. Now I can appreciate you more than ever. Flattery never works on me. Then that's the end of our company. What a waste! Sir, I talked to my brother. I shouldn't be so stubborn. May I stay here? Sure. Good thing you corrected your mistake. Yes, sir. This is burning hot! I'm sorry! Wait. Bring my hat. I'm going out. Yes. I suppose I have to help you out. Let's go see what kind of trouble you've gotten into. What a bother. You want to join us? Thank you. I hope he agrees to come. Maybe you should have gone. He would have been even more stubborn with me. I don't know what to say to him. I'll say to him: "Let me marry your daughter." He'll respond: "I'll give thee a punch for thy dowry." Perhaps! - He's here. - Wonderful. Hello. Oh, my. Could you really afford all this? It's great that you came. I don't know about great, but someone needs my help. Oh, I see. Father, these are all our products. Take a look. Father. I'm sorry. Things happen. Hello, I'm Nonaka. We met on the train. Hello there. Yes, things happen. I do artwork for the music boxes. Is that right? Well, things happen, I guess. We'll see how good you are. Madame. Oh, dear. What happened? I'm horrified by my current boss. Can I work at this company? Let me see. Ume is looking for a job. Hire her. Like they say: "One good turn deserves another." You need other people to succeed in life. You've got one great factory here. Everyone! I'm Taro's father. I'll be joining this company as a business consultant. Consider me as your father. Okay. Now back to work. Work efficiently, too. It's Sunday, right? Yes. Let's enjoy our golden years. Huh? I can see. You're in love. THE END
