Do you want subtitles for any video? -=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=- The Play of God. Presenting debut actors: Lal Composition: Yesudas, Kaithapram (Clown character enters) Stand back. Where's the master? Master ! Master ! Master. Did a fox get him? - If so, fox will die of indigestion. That's true, poor fox. Master? What the ears hear, eyes dont see. What do you want, Paniyan Why the unnecessary shouting? We are not deaf. Was enquiring whether a fox caught you for dinner, Master. Dont hit me. I'll catch your lesson. Its not 'catch a lesson', its 'learn a lesson'. That's what I said. 'Catch your lesson'. Not pronouncing right. Say 'learn my lesson'. Exactly, will catch your lesson. You really need some fixing today. Why dont you ever learn? What are you doing here ? - Just having fun, master. Why are you here? - At the Big Fire... What ? - The Big Fire... Then go there. Why are you here ? Alright, you go there, I'll remain here. Eh? - You're angry again. I'll stay here, you go there. You really need a lesson today. Watch, I'm going to jump on the Big Fire. If you're scared, close your eyes. This is too small a fire for me, I feel too cold to jump. Paniyan ! Did you know, Tamara eloped with Perumalayan. The Lord doesnt know it yet. Come fast, come soon. Lets inform the Lord, come. I even gave you the key to my money chest. Yet, you cheated me like this. How many times must I tell you. I never imagined this would happen. Told you a 100 times, they're both in love. And you replied that Tamara hates Kannan. Well, I hate Kannan now. I will fix this, Lord. Many people advised Kannan Perumalayan to return land that belongs to me. When people of Eka-land told him that, Do you know what he replied ? He already gave it to Kanthan ! Because of Kannan, my due was given to Kanthan instead. Tell me Lord, do u think I love him now? If I was in your place, I would've murdered him I have hands and legs too. I can dance too. But to him, I'm 'just Paniyan. Clown who prepares the stage. Just to remove evil's eye from his Theechamundi character. I too wish to play the main role of Theechamundi one day. Speak all you want. After this, you will go back to being Kannan's tail again. Tiring because we climbed Urali hill. Shout loud. The Lord must be asleep. He's always asleep. That's why she did this. He's ignorant that his own daughter left the house. We had to cross these hills to let him know! Lord ! Lord ! Snug in his house on a hill. Lord! Lord! Lord! Lord! Why are you shouting ? Something important. Your daughter Tamara has eloped. She's sleeping in her room, how dare you insult her. You are blabbering after getting drunk. We walked here this cold night, through rough terrain. We must have a good reason, dont you think? And who are you ? Son of younger lord at Mannaat Haven't we prohibited u from coming here? We wont give Tamara to you. See, we're here late in the night. We have a reason. What's the reason? We want to know.. Did Tamara marry Perumalayan with your consent ? If so, we're wrong. If not, then you shouldnt have insulted us when we came to help you. Tamara's act is outrageous. Eloped with someone with no family or reputation. It is wrong ! - Are you saying the truth? Why dont you check in her room. Daughter. Tell Lord to come to Shadayanur junction. In this case, I must act like I'm on Perumalayan's side. If I get a chance, I'll backstab him. But I must act like his friend. Bring the Lord and people to Mallot. I'll be there. Paniyan. The Lord spoke outrageous things about you. I could barely tolerate it. Be careful. These lords wont hesitate to hurt you. They'll hurt you any way they can. The ruler has also heard the news. Nobody will say I am unsuitable for Tamara. The ruler knows what race my mind and body belongs to. True. Still.. Be careful, Perumalayan. Townsmen forget love and friendship for their selfish interests. Dont be afraid, Paniyan. I did not 'steal' her or anything. Paniyan. Why didnt you go to the stage? Need to occupy it till Perumalayan's role enters. Stomach's not well. Always the clown, you are. Time to go to the stage. Do it as you will. The Lord's daughter.. - Yes, I heard too. Kanthan. You all go ahead. Come. Kantha, did you know? Issue of Perumalayan's marriage. Heard in Pudiyannoor itself. Everyone's talking about it. Perumalayan is that popular ! Oh its not because of that. Its because the girl is daughter of the Lord. Whoever he marries, some people will talk like this. But.. Perumalayan shouldn't have. Its not a mistake. Its a manly brave act. The main Goddess role has begun. Come. Stop. My daughter, who I brought up, has run away. Her life is ruined. What must I do, oh Goddess? Dont ! Right now, he is Goddess herself. Let his role end. No, dont go there now. Perumalayan, dont. Kill him! Do not move. Where's my daughter? What do you have to say? You have a better weapon than swords to punish me with. The authority of being her guardian. Bitch ! What black magic did u cast to seduce her? Tie him up ! No one moves. Whether you're on my side or not. This isn't the place for violence. Where must I reply to your complaint, Lord? Stop it. Forgive me Lord. There are diplomatic solutions for any problem. The ruler has arrived. Let him decide. What has happened? My daughter... She's gone. Did she die? - Yes. Now she is dead to me. He cast black magic to seduce her. And he took her away. In this case, ... ...u have the right to punish whoever did it. Even if my son was behind it, u may decide to punish. Thank you, Ruler. Here stands the guilty one. The popular one in town, our Perumalayan.. Kannan. Perumalayan, what do you have to say ? He wont have anything. Oh Ruler, who stands equal to God. Oh masters. Its true the Lord's daughter is with me. I have married her, yes. From the time I was 7 years old,... ..I've walked the path of fire until today. This world is huge... ..but I know nothing of it beyond my Theyyam dance. I dont know how to justify the morality of my act. But I do know this: Our love is true. I have not used any black magic to win her. My daughter is timid. Would she love and marry someone like him who induces fear? Good one. She cannot provoke everyone and do this knowingly. Malayan. I've heard he's great at black magic. We cant act on your rumours. Do you have proof that he seduced her by magic? Perumalayan, is your relationship real? I request we bring Tamara here. Let her say it. After she says, you can decide whether to punish me. Where's Tamara? - Kanthan.. Bring her please. Tamara, the ruler wants to see you. Before she comes here.. ..let me confess everything I've done, as if I speak to God. Speak it. Her father did like me. Lord would often invite me to his house. It was his hobby to hear my sob stories. About my family who died of leprosy. They thought I died, wrapped me in a mat, threw me into the fire. Before I was burnt, someone pulled me out of the pyre. Stories of when I started playing the fire role. How I climbed up and down the large Meleri fire pile. Once when playing the Theechamundi (fire role), I was burnt in the fire.. I cried out to God. And she came to me as a relief, I saw her gazing from the window of Lord's house. My burnt body and scarring stories brought tears to her face. After the stories, I realized her heart was reaching out to me. I could've spared her those stories. But I knew she yearned to be with someone like me. She loved me. Moved by her empathy to my life's sorrows, I too loved her. This is the only magic trick I used. Enough. Dont take this story lightly. There comes Tamara, let her say. Please listen to what she says, Ruler. If she is even a little guilty in this case,... ...may all the curses I directed at Perumalayan fall on me instead ! Speak, girl, what's the truth here? Forgive me, Father. I am indebted to u for giving me life. I shall always respect u as my father. To that extent, I shall remain your daughter. However, this man here is my husband. Recall how Mom obeyed u more than her father? I owe my husband that amount of obedience. May God protect you. I have nothing more to say. I dont want her back anymore. I'd rather adopt another daughter. Perumalayan. I give her to you, wholeheartedly. Ruler, I have nothing more to say. Let this go. Perumalayan is truly suitable for your daughter. Bless them. May you prosper. Perumalayan. She betrayed her Father. Beware, she may betray you too. What do I do now? Go and sleep well. I'd rather commit suicide ! Lord. First, learn to love yourself. Would you rather die for one girl, or marry 10 others ? Tamara will not last very long with Kannan. Right now, they're in honeymoon phase. But soon you will see him throw her out like rubbish. So, save all the money you can. Will you help me? I told you I hate Perumalayan ! Do you know which Theyyam that is ? 'The nameless role'. But even the 'nameless' one's name is famous now. Yet I remain the clown, the 'Paniyan'. Dont worry Paniyan. I'll give you as much money as you want. I want to see Tamara once. Perumalayan will head home after the wedding celebration. You head to the farm beside it. I'll tell Perumalayan to go via the farm. I'm doing this for you. Let her know you are dirty rich! Let's make it grander, I'll get some guys to announce it! You keep this much with you now. Let's meet beside the farm. Perumalayan, you bitch. You made me a Paniyan. I'll make u a real joker. A joker the world will laugh at. Watch out ! Brought a gift for you, Udupel-ma. How do u like it ? Come closer, my girl. Come. What's this one's name? - Tamara. Did you give her this name? No.its the Lord's nickname for her. A true Tamara (Lotus) ! What a beautiful girl ! Like seeing the moon ! Bring some soot. Soot.. where can I ?.. Get some from the lamp, kid. Ok. You are lucky to have her, daughter. He may not be that handsome.. ..but even the Gods dont have a heart as big as him. Where should I put this? Should I teach u this too? Here. Lets cast the evil's eye away. There will be many cast your way. Cherish this dream. Take care of him well. She had to let go of her palace to come to your hut. You shouldnt have discarded them, son. I dont have a Mother. Now I lost my Father too. Please consider me ur daughter. May you live long. She plays the Goddess role too. Whatever she says, will come true. Get lost, you. Labelling this old woman a Goddess? Step into the house, children. Sun rises in that direction. We must watch every sunrise from now on. My roles usually go on till daylight. So I usually only catch the sunsets. On days when Udupel-ma is not around... ..I sit there, alone. What do you think of when watching the sunset? About us. That you'll be beside me here, one day. And that we walk there, into the horizon. The time right after sunset is the best. There's a sadness in my mind and around this place. My dead parents and siblings... ..I imagine them standing beside me, and I start crying. Udupelamma also has no one. Like me. Her house is beside that hill. When she comes here, I'm often relieved. Its all like a dream. This place, house, and our love. The townspeople can talk or envy all they want. I dont want to change the beauty on this face Did Perumalayan steal the Lord's daughter, Udupelamma? Ask him urself. You'll get a nice scolding. Just see her and leave, ok? We dont want ur opinions. Her arms are so soft. Tamara. I'll be back. Why did you call? Enough. No need to elaborate more to them. They're just happy for us. No need. I dont like people touching your hand. He's just a kid, no? Maybe.. but I dont like it.. Ok, then I wont go. Happy ? Walk faster. Paniyan's wife, Cheerma. Dont let Tamara be in sunlight for long, Perumalayan. She'll get tanned, like my wife. But Cheerma is fair. Yea, remind him that, Tamara. In his eyes, everyone is dark. That's the problem. Right ? Start cribbing already ? Alright, my wife is the most beautiful, ok? Ya, right. Brought some snacks for you. - Such a lot ! Now Cheerma will give u company, Tamara. Dont unlock her mouth, hard to shut her up. Better than your mouth, its open even in sleep. Come, Tamara Where's Kanthan? - Coming. He's bringing a Mandaara-bed (bed covered with orchid flowers). Saw them at the junction. The whole gang is there. Master is leading them. Paniyan. What is it ? - Come. Why did you stop there? Why did you invite me for Perumalayan's marriage celebration? I cant cook birds/animals and eat meat. I'm a Lord (Brahmin) This is why everyone says Lord Unni is stupid. Perumalayan's wife is also daughter of a Lord. Tamara, the one this Lord Unni loves. Its true what they say - when you're in love, caste barriers dont matter. What a great plan ! What benefit is it to u if I get Tamara? I do get benefits. I want to keep Kanthan away from Tamara. What are you saying ? After her fascination for Perumalayan's sob stories dies down,... ..she will want someone else. Who better than Kanthan to bring her to her knees? Since she's naive, things will get easier. Dont say rubbish. Its not rubbish. Kanthan has everything that Perumalayan lacks. He's young, good-looking... Excellent singer. More than enough to woo the Lord girl. She wont go astray like that. I know her well. No other girl in Eka-land is as virtuous as her. If she was virtuous, why did she love Perumalayan ? You saw them return after the wedding. Guess who's bringing the orchid-covered bed for Perumalayan? Its Kanthan. Kanthan is even more qualified in using black magic.. ...to seduce women, better than Perumalayan. So what can I do ? We must break the bond between Perumalayan and Kanthan. How ? When alcohol touches his tongue, Kanthan's tone and behaviour changes. Gets to partying and dancing. Then its just a prod away. Today's celebration will go to shambles. Since I'm with them, I may not be able to do it. But everyone would recognize me. Put on a beard and moustache. And a wig and costume No one except Perumalayan will be in their wits by then. Join in only after the drinking and singing has begun. I'll smoothly remove Perumalayan from the scene. Lord.. get ready for the game. After Perumalayan kicks out Kanthan,... Tamara has only one person to go to. This one. Where were you? When we reached Kekkammar we realized we forgot to bring it. What ? - 'It'. Then we found a shop somehow. Are you going to roast and eat all these ? Master, shouldnt you be advising the kids against this? What's in your hand? - Its nothing. This is a wedding celebration, right ? Partying should be allowed today. Kannan, are you going to drink too ? No. - Better not. What, what did you just advise? That he can do anything he wants. We'll obey you girls only when the sun rises in the west. So shall we begin? - Let us ! Where's the Master? Master ! Master ! I hand over this silk robe to you. Guard it like treasure. This is as valuable as my life. Its been passed on through generations. The only heirloom I have. An old belief says that.. .. if we lose this, even our relationship will fall apart. Beside the Vannaathi river.. When the Moon gazes into the mirror.. Oh lady, who came out pursuing her dream. By the red-flower garden. You, who threw out your chest of pearls.. On Thiruvathira night.. you enter, like Goddess Parvati. Girl, this night, whom do you seek ? As a wed girl.. Why did you come to the forest of flowers ? You are the full moon's light, out for its nightwalk. Am I not in your dreams filled with passion ? Did you see it ? Its ok, he did it unknowingly. What are you guys watching? Continue the song. Get away you ! - What, what's happening ? He's hitting me ! - Dont you escape ! Get away from here. Let him go, let him go. Let him go. Please help. Perumalaya, he's hitting the Master ! Perumalayan, please come and help. Perumalayan, come fast. Kanthan ! Leave him. Stop it ! Let me go. Stop it. Perumalayan, I didnt do anything. Dont utter a word. Someone's trying to create trouble here. Enough, stop it. You're arrogant enough to beat Master? Perumalayan.. I.. I dont want your justification. I.. I didnt do anything wrong. Our master comes from a lineage of Manakkadan masters. You forgot all that? I.. Perumalayan.. I.. Its all clear to me. When townspeople said it, I defended you. But no more. You shall not play roles in Eka-land anymore. If I hold any say over these forests, I hereby decree.. Kanthan shall no longer play the Theyyam here ! Perumalayan.. I.. Move away. I will say it only once. You shall not.. play the Theyyam here any longer. Perumalayan. Kanthan. I lost everything. How can I live without playing the Theyyam anymore? What are you guys watching ? Leave ! Kanthan, be calm. We'll find a solution to this. No.. Perumalayan never goes back on his words. But Perumalayan has lost out to only one person. That person can influence Perumalayan. Who is that ? - Tamara. When she tells him.. ..the 'Lord of Fire' Perumalayan will obey. But.. I.. Nothing wrong in it. Tomorrow, go tell her your sorrows. You didnt do it on purpose, right? It was just an accident. She'll speak on your behalf. And Perumalayan will listen to her, too. Your ban will be lifted. Are you sure about this ? I swear on my Theyyam role. The Perumalayan will listen if she says. I didnt think artists can give such a good beating. This too shall pass, Lord Unni. Scars take time to heal. No pain, no gain. This isnt magic. Its plain human brilliance. It never fails to work. Our plan is moving ahead, right ? Kanthan beat you up. In return, we got Kanthan banned I dont understand it. Guess I'll end up returning to Kodagu penniless. Just because I trusted your words. - True. I deserve to hear this, eh? For all that I had planned for you. Kanthan's bond with Perumalayan is broken. Now Kanthan will go after Tamara. Requesting his ban be lifted. The more she requests it, the worse his suspicions will get. When his character's dark side begins to show, she will hate him She rejected her comfortable Lord house without thinking of it. Tamara will become so remorseful of that decision. And she will turn to Lord Unni. I dreamt for all this to happen. But now... I wasn't accusing you, Paniyan. Calm down. - No, I think I'll leave now. I think I'll meet Perumalayan and tell him the truth. Poor Tamara.. let her continue living with Perumalayan. Paniyan, dont get so hurt. Come here. Let's end this friendship, Lord. You'll lose your money, honour.. And you'll end up hurt. I dont care about all that. Tired of all this. How much money you need? I'll give you. No need. Look at me. My only wish is to get Tamara. But.. you suspected me. I'm hurt. I'll touch your feet in repentance. - What are you doing ? Here, keep this. Paniyan strongly suggested it to me. Divine force acted through him, sending me to you. My mind feels free now, like a forest cleared. Paniyan is a nice man. Always trying to help. Ya right. He really only looks after his own interests. That's the real him. There's a medic in Marutha who can treat infertility. For 2 years, I've been telling we should go meet him. How unpredictably things are changing. Sorrows enter amidst our laughter. All that feels like some magical illusion to me. Some bearded guy sneaks behind me in that darkness. Did he come to steal? Or did he get the wrong guy somehow ? Then it was all shouting. I dont recollect anything. Tamara.. Please request Perumalayan to remove my ban. If you say it, he wont refuse it. I'm sure. Sure. I'll remove his anger today itself. I interpret it comes from his disgust towards your drinking. He doesn't love you any less. Just because of disgust, he alienated me to this extent ? If he decides to give all my rights and roles to someone else.. That wont happen. I also want your previous bond to be restored. Cheerma is my witness. I swear to you... If it works out, what will you give me for mediating ? Bottle of liquor might work. Let me leave. What ? Isnt that Kanthan ? (Tamara: wonder why he left soon) - Perumalayan: Yes. This doesn't look good. Why ? Why did he run on seeing you ? What are you implying ? Hmm. Maybe its nothing. What ? - Its nothing. Hubby is coming. I should leave. Kannan Perumalayan's wife now plays mediator to many. For whom ? - Kanthan. It was an accident. His face makes it obvious, he isn't lying. Let him first stop drinking alcohol. During the time we started loving each other.. I used to have a bad opinion of you. Kanthan defended you, spoke highly of you, and changed my opinion. I am sad for him. Lets see. Did you want to say something ? No.. just that.. Felt like I should be saying something. Remember to say it when I'm back. This is my first play after the wedding. When I think of getting onto the fire, a bit of fear.. Dont know why.. this is the first time. Wait. Dont call back a man set on his task. Why are you flirting around here now, Perumalayan We have stops to make before the play. When you're in love, these small things are such a joy. You're getting into the fire. Be careful. Dont be afraid, girl. Please come, Perumalayan. What happened to you Paniyan? - Nothing. I've been thinking stuff. Is it about Cheerma ? You know I never think about myself. I just dont want my loved ones to be hurt. Say, Perumalayan... Did Tamara know Kanthan earlier ? It was Kanthan who helped us with our relationship all along. If not for him, I dont know whether our relationship would have lasted. I see. I thought they didnt know each other earlier. I see. What is it Paniyan? - Oh, nothing. Its really nothing. I'm just.. nah. It cant be possible. No.. you're thinking of something. How can I speculate what's on my mind wihout any evidence ? I'm sure there's something you're hiding. Speak it, Paniyan. Dont worry about evidence now. But how can I tell it to your face.. no. Is it about Kanthan ? Do you suspect Kanthan of something ? Suspect.. maybe.. Maybe I'm j ust imagining it. My mind is dirty, thinks bad things. So be it. Just say it anyway. Based on what I know... No.. its not appropriate.. Dont get me mad with curiosity, Paniyan. I cant bear it. Whatever hell it is, just open up and let it loose. Ok I'll say it. You do know I love you, right. I believe so. Not just you, but Tamara too. Kanthan loves me too. Its what I believe. Who can say what the truth is or who is hiding behind lies. When he gets drunk, Kanthan loses control. But when sober, would he ever cheat me ? No he wont. Until we find evidence, you continue to trust in him You dont trust Kanthan. Its written on your face. If you're a good friend, speak openly to me. You wouldnt allow me to be cheated. I wont allow it ! But I dont want to backbite another friend either. That's why I'm confused. So I'm being cheated !? Its wrong of you to hide it any longer. If you do that, you are my enemy. Lets say a woman cheats on her husband. If your woman.. no I'm not talking about Tamara here.. If the husband discovers it and kicks her out of his life, the problem is solved. But if he continues to love her despite knowing what she's upto... ..then his heart is just hell. What's the meaning of all this? Tell me. Tell me clearly. No, Paniyan. Before I suspect her, I need tangible evidence. Happy to hear that. Atleast now I have a chance to show my love and loyalty to you. I cant say about evidence now. You.. be careful about your wife. Observe how she interacts with Kanthan. Just stay alert, no need to suspect yet. I know the behaviour of women in Eka-land. They hide unspeakable things from their husbands. Is this your opinion ? Remember what Tamara's father cursed in front of the Rulers ? "She betrayed her own father, she may betray you too." What nonsense I'm saying here. I just spoke out of love for you. Forgive me. I'm indebted to you forever. I think I've caused you grief, Perumalayan. No, not at all. Dont cause problems because of what I said. I meant.. keep your suspicions hidden, but be alert. I wont cause problems. Kanthan is my close friend. If you make any issues.. you're looking so hurt. No.. I'm fine. I still believe Tamara is loyal. Live and let live. Think that, and survive on. I wonder, would she do something like that ? Exactly, that's the point. Let me be frank. She rejected proposals from so many Lords, to be with you. When she compares those handsome choices against your face,.. ..dont you think she resents it ? True. If you learn anything more, let me know. Tell Cheerma to watch out, too. Dont be hurt by what I said. Its good to remove the ban on Kanthan. He is talented. But if you keep the ban for a while... ...we will know if only Tamara who thinks this way. We'll see if your girl puts up a fight for Kanthan. We can conclude many things from that. For now, just keep it as a suspicion. Assume Tamara is completely loyal. I beg you. (Prayer to Goddess) Why are you looking dull ? Why didnt you tell me you had returned? I have a headache. Let me put some balm on your forehead. Does the color make me look uglier ? No, not at all. How can you ever love this face ? I never found any flaws with this face. If ever, the more I see it, the better it looks to me. My fortune. Tired of playing the clown. With your help, we can remove all our problems. What do you want me to do ? We may never get this opportunity again. Have you seen where it is kept ? If I get it, I can make all our dreams happen. You always say I'm stupid. So explain to this stupid one, please. What gains can you make from just a silk robe ? You needn't know details. Each year brings Kannan's family more and more progress. Kannan's family fortune has been like that. No other family has made steady progress up the ladder. Each new son is born with 10 new talents. Dont we also wish for a son who is talented ? Dont I need a reprieve from this clown role ? Atleast for once, a solo main role. I want to play Theechamundi too. Doesn't every artist wish for praise and gifts from the Rulers ? Dont you wish these things too ? Right now, all that is in your hands. Only you can get that silk robe by getting info from Tamara. Maybe not forever. We'll keep it just for one day. Just one day. What say ? Do you remember your mother ? No. I have only seen a damaged photo of hers. Mother was beautiful. You must have inherited her beauty then. I dont think I'm beautiful. But Kannan keeps insisting otherwise. Perumalayan is fortunate. I believe I am the fortunate one. Frankly, I am so envious of both your fortunes. I've never been happy for even one day after marriage. I cant even become a Mother. It will all turn out ok. Just tie a cradle in Flower forest. All my wishes come true when I do that. Wait here a moment, I'll be back. Where are you going, I'll join you. - No, nowhere. I'll start the fire on the stove and be back. Cheerma.. Where has she gone ? Cheerma. Cheerma. Laughing ? I feel terrible doing this. I cheated her. Still, this laughter makes up for it.. I know you'd do anything to make me happy. Perumalayan. What rubbish you told me yesterday. I haven't slept well. Not able to. When eyes close, images of what you said flash in front of my eyes. Why did you do this to me, Paniyan? Why are you overthinking this ? I only said I had a doubt. Your 'doubt'. Never come to me again. You've trapped me in a well I will drown in. The spectators of Kaliyattam (play) and the artists can all crave for her. I would rather be ignorant of it. But now I am... I've lost all my joy and peace of mind. To all my play roles.. To all the fires I have danced to... I bid goodbye to you, who made me great. To the drumbeats who gave me passion... To the flutes who infused God into me. I am beginning to separate from you. The Gods shall no longer reside on Perumalayan's fingers. What, have you gone mad ? Yes, you made me a madman. You must prove to me that my wife is an infidel. I want tangible proof. If you cant, I swear on the Gods, I will kill you ! What have I... - I dont want to hear it. I want to see evidence. Your allegations against her are now burning me in fire. So you must die. May God help you, then. I shall not play any roles anymore. I dont want to live in a world of lies. Sincerity and innocence are no longer valued here. Thank you for making me understand that. Friendship is a sin. I wont befriend anyone anymore. Paniyan. No need Perumalayan, I'm done. Paniyan, stop. I agree, you are a true friend. Its ok. "My wife is an infidel." I must both believe it and not believe it, at the same time. I trust you, but I need evidence. You want evidence ? I really need it. I'll give you. You want tangible evidence, right ? I'll give it. I have no peace of mind.. Why are you so depressed ? You're a renowned singer Panicker. You are healthy, have a girl who loves you. If I can't participate in Theyyam, what use is marriage. No girl can love a drunkard. You are going to lose me! Beware Are you 2 fighting? If you touch liquor, it's off between us. My parents can find me another groom. Damayanti.. Damayanti has a point, Kantha. Poor her.. Lost everything. Job.Peace of mind. Now Damayanti too left me -Dont worry. God wont forsake good people. Gone What is it, child? Nothing. So are you crying for no reason? If I tell you something, will you scold me ? Ofcourse not. My child, tell me what happened. I cant find it now. He gave it to me the day I arrived here. What are u talking about? That silk robe. I'd kept it safely. Dont know how I lost it. Did you search everywhere, child? - Yes. What do I tell him now? Dont need to tell him for now. Go search, first What's the secret? -Cheerma, did you see the red silk robe? It's missing for 2 days. I'm lucky Kannan hasn't asked me yet What do I do now? -Dont worry. It should be around here somewhere. He wouldn't remember amidst preparations for the fest. -Exactly. I cant lie to Kannan -You needn't lie. Wait a few days. I'll find it for you. From where? -From somewhere. Be calm, Tamara. We want to hold a mega fest in Vilapuram Gods are enraged. Epidemics returning to the village. Crops and pets dying. Love between humans has died as well -It has been postponed for long. I'd like to do a big one this year, and continue an annual Kaliyattam (Play of God) Perumalayan, can you lead this? Sure. - Go ahead with it then. We will make plans and inform you of preparations. Ur play is on December 10. Its a grand Kaliyattam, we want you to personally perform. I have not performed the big one yet, due to my caste. Doesn't matter, you are up to it. Moreover, during divination, the Gods favored you. So be it - Alright. We take our leave. Come with me. Dont forget my word. I will give you.. ..real evidence before the big play is over. I promise. Oh God ! What have you done ! What's happened to Kannan? -Dont know. First time I see him so angry. Something troubling his mind. Why else would he throw the token fee? Yes, I agree. - His mind must be pure when performing the fire dance. If not, the fire will burn his mind. The heat will seep in. They say even the performer's wife must do fasting for him I'm ready to do any fasting for him. Your willingness to fast itself is enough, child. Pray for his mind to be alright. Oh God. I pray Paniyan is unable to find evidence before Kaliyattam ends. (prayers) As high as Blue mountains, and as low as the valley. The roots of the native Banyan tree grow. In all coves where divine lamp is lit Theyyam will mark its presence in February. Forgive me. Dont. I have begun my fast.. Let the big performance get over. I will love you. More than I have ever done before. Long time since I dorned play robes. This year, I'll also perform the Theyyam. For you 2. For both of you to be happy always. Why are u 2 so late? Husband and wife seem to be in love Initial part is over. The player will exit now. Can Tamara sleep over at Udupelamma's pavillion? I think better not. Udupelama is on fast. Ruler suggested the Madam can stay at the canteen. I'll stay at Kannan's pavilion - That's not allowed, Tamara I am on fast, too. You stay in canteen. Come over to the pavilion once in a while I can ask Cheerma to accompany you. Where is Cheerma? Gone to buy vermillion. She's old, but in mood for cosmetics now! - I'll be back, just a minute Come, lets go to the pavilion. Such an impulsive demon. Sometimes he sleeps on the bed, sometimes he burns it Hey, reached early? - Yes, last night itself. I heard your bed's near the kitchens. I'll always be near Kannan. Who cares about the fast? Did you know Udupelamma is playing a role this time ? -No. Yes, she's here. Come - Let me pay first. Here. Come. Where's your 'dear one' ? Must be with Cheerma Come with me. Look. Did you observe Tamara's eyes when she came here? Ya right.. as if you would ever notice these things. Her attention was elsewhere. Didn't I tell u? Look ! You wanted proof? I'll give it to you. Right here. Before the big play ends. Remember - my job is not really to rescue you from an infidel woman. I reminded him twice. -That wont do. You must insist. I'm quite depressed being alienated from the play. You have been cheating me for so long. Lord Unni. I was just planning to meet up with you. I've lost what I lost. I'm going to end up a complete loser here. Lost my time.. my money. I now understand.. it was all in vain. I'll never get Tamara. First learn to trust in yourself, then question others. This fire of doubt will weaken you, Lord. Clown ! - Get lost ! See? This is my state now. I have several better characters I can play. Bhairavan of Naalankandam, Aaroli Ruchittan. Honestly speaking, even the Villavaram role. God is watching everything. The role of Vilavram Bhagavathar will find its way to me soon. I get the feeling I'm irrelevant here. I'll end up bottom of the list. - No, things have progressed. Almost within arm's reach now! All that's left is for me to grab her and drop her in your lap. You are bluffing. - No. Then let me hear it. Come straight to the point. You may decide date and time. Are you serious? -Yes. I'll go to Kodagu hills first. And buy a pepper plantation for us. And build a house. -Good plan. Dont remain here with Tamara. The Lord and Madam's marriage... Kodagu Hills it is! Here.. give this to my Tamara. This is the last time I give courier service. I cant be your messenger always, ok? You 2 are only bothered about yourselves. Always talking about romance with each other. Once you take her to Kodagu, will you care about me? You think I'd ever forget you, Paniya? Kantha, I've been searching for you. Whose camp is this? - Ambupanickan. His Theyyam is tomorrow. Playing 'Bhairavan'. Since I have no role, I decided to do this. I hear the big play will be a big hit. As Perumalayan said, in Eka-land no one can match our troupe's fame. You may feel proud and happy. But how long must I remain useless like this. I was all alone today. No one to even speak to. Damayanti is also missing. No one from home either. Mom considers me her enemy. This too shall pass. Hold the goddess tightly in your heart. Where'd you get this robe? -Fell into my hands by luck! Looks beautiful. -Dont know where it came from. When I awoke, the robe was in my lap. I'm not kidding, Paniya. Feels like a dream. Anyway, some relief for me after this robe came to me. Stopped drinking. I'll give it to Damayanti if she comes. She'd be happy. True. She'd be happy. There. Around it, there. Like that. Wrap it around About the lamp, I'd asked... -Dont bother, they'll manage it Ok - Perumalayan Wrap it close together. What is it? Did you have a red silk robe with u? Not 'had', I still have it. Really? Correct that to 'had', not 'have'. What are you saying? -Listen to me patiently. Give me your word on that - Tell me That silk robe is with Kanthan. Saw it with my own eyes Dont be weak. I'm there for you. I promise on Villavaram goddess, I'll support you for anything. I can understand your situation I myself felt so hurt when I realized u're being cheated. So I can guess the pain you are undergoing. Must kill him. Yes, but dont do anything to her. Her too ! - If you kill him, she becomes yours. She who cheats must not live. Ok, I'm with you. I only regret I cant kill both of them twice for you. But it's not time yet. Must think twice before making such decisions This is not child's play. It's murder. Not some cat or dog. Homicide. I'm still not convinced. The robe might still be with her. She must not have given it. You must have imagined it. She cannot give it away. I searched the house fully before I came here. Not sure where that robe went. How can I tell Kannan it is lost ? For now, dont tell him I believe it'll be found before Kaliyattam is over. I can bear losing anything else... Thank God he believes me blindly -Does Perumalayan ever doubt u? No, never Doubt would not enter even his dreams. Here he comes. I'm going to insist that he allow Kanthan back. I'll be indoors. Your hands are wet. Maybe because I'm very happy. You must observe a fast too. Hot sweaty hands. I'm donning a costume and jumping into fire. The Malayan's wife must have purity too. I am fasting too. Just didn't inform you. I'd done the same fasting to get wed to you. Be careful. These are hands that offered your heart to me. Dont take excessive freedom with it. Beware. What about the issue I asked you about ? What ? I told Kanthan today that I'd make everything alright. I am leaving for the temple. Oh, where is that robe? Robe.. er.. I think it's at home. Tell the truth. Where is it? It is most valuable to me. It is my life U're changing the topic to avoid my request. Cant you take Kanthan back ? I ask you, where is that robe !? Cant you make things alright for Kanthan? Where is that robe ? Seriously, I think it was your mistake. -Oh God ! The Perumalayan doubts u, Tamara. I've never seen him like this. That robe is magical or something. Sad that I lost it. What should I do ? It's ok, child. Maybe the robe was just an excuse to get angry. Male mind is not as we think. First, they love greedily. As days pass, they grow tired and avoid us. No Cheerma, Kannan is not like that. It is my mistake I hope it's as you say. Awaiting the Hero she was, fasting.. Chembarathy, beautiful as a peacock feather Dawns passed, dusk passed.. She alone survived without food Just to see the Hero once more. ..she awaited in pain and patience. (Repeat) In the deep caverns of Kudagu hills, he was. 7 obstacles, 17 hills stood facing the Hero After he crossed them, a conch was blown - The Lord honored the Hero. Many full-moons passed. The storm blew away the lamps of the school. While Hero was seething in anger, Kudagan's hands stabbed him behind his back. My tears swelled up, flooded my mind city. My cries were loud, my mind's fort broke down. Hearing Hero's story, she burned in pain. Chembarathy, as beautiful as a peacock feather. Many dawns passed, her friends left her. She decided to jump into the fire herself. She flew like a bird, close by the Hero's side. So you haven't seen anything suspicious? Not only that, I dont doubt her at all. But you told me you saw her with Kanthan? I heard what they spoke. Nothing inappropriate in that conversation. But they spoke something while you were away. Nothing bad has happened. I can vouch, Tamara's not an infidel. If someone told you otherwise, I curse him with destruction! Honestly, u're lucky to have got Tamara. Leave. Ask her to come here. Ettan, had you called ? Let me see your eyes. Look at my face. What happened to you, Ettan? I dont understand what u're saying. You look pale. Who are you ? - Your wife. Promise me you haven't cheated me. I promise on the Goddess. I could never do that. But the gods have seen your treachery. No! What mistake are you accusing me of? Go. Go away from me. Your eyes are watery. Is it because of me ? My girl, why are you so beautiful ? I'm burning because of your beauty. Oh Goddess, forgive me You please forgive me. Forgive me. I still love you. What trash he has thought up! Dont cry, child. He must've misunderstood somewhere. You still trust him? I have no one. I can do nothing but cry. Tamara, are you crying? What happened? How can she not !? Perumalayan has been blabbering a lot of nonsense Perumalayan would normally not do that... Dont cry, child She ran away from her palace home for him. So sad that she has to hear such things. I know I'm unlucky. There's a limit to doing nonsense. Why should you bear everything just because he's Perumalayan? Dont cry ! What should I do to change his mind? I know he must be having good intentions. Please tell him I apologize for errors I may have done. Forgive him, child. I'll change his mind, I promise ! Am I seeing and hearing the truth, Paniya? Would my Tamara give that away? Here he goes again ! You know, you cant visually see this thing called virginity. Imagine her lying alongside Kanthan with that robe... If something of that sort happens... I've heard and seen it. Men like to boast of such relationships, like their trophies. What did he say ? He.. and Tamara.. Perumalaya.. what happened. What's happened? This is the 2nd time. He fell yesterday too. Maybe epilepsy. No, I doubt it. Come, let's pick him up No need. He'll recover with a little rest. Get some water. No, I... - Go, go now ! How are u? Alright? What, are you sarcastic? -No, I'm serious ! Now what if you had personally witnessed all I described? Was he speaking the truth? -U're a man, dont be a wimp. Many men are cheated around the world like this. I pity you. you still lay with the woman who cheated you. If I were in your position, I would have taken measures. U're right about all this. Stay away from here for a while. When you were unconscious, Kanthan had come here. I've asked him to return here. You can eavesdrop, while I talk. I'll bring up 'the topic' with him. Observe his expressions. Observe while he describes.. how many times where.. when.. with your wife.. This shall be the evidence. Dont attempt to take revenge immediately. Ok. But.. I want to kill him There's time for that. Dont do it now. Hide for now. Go.. I'll ask Kanthan about Damayanti now. He will speak happily. The love-crazy Perumalayan will think that we're talking about Tamara. Where's Perumalayan? - He left. How's he now ? He's fine. I told you its nothing. Give me that. So, what news on your side, my Panicker boy. When I hear 'Panicker', I get reminded that.. ..I lost that post in the play. Dont worry man. Keep behind that Tamara. She would've fixed this for you long ago. If you had told Damayanti... poor girl, eh ! A girl who loves a man so much ! Poor her. We are deeply in love. She came to me, sometime ago. Feel like seeing her, wherever I go. She followed me to the fair, the other night. Then we lied down on my mat together. Didn't want to ask her to leave. We hugged tight and slept There's Damayanti. Why did you come here? - 'Why' ? To see your whore! you gifted me her silkrobe it seems. Never thought u were so cheap ! What are u doing, Damayanti ! Go appease her, Panicker. Damayanti, listen to me first ! I dont want to hear anything. Dont follow me now. Stop, Damayanti. I know nothing of this Saw that ? - Paniya.. How do I kill him ? Saw how he laughed at all his adultery ? And, saw the robe? That 'precious gift' to your wife ! That was my evidence ! Yes. I saw it. Oh Goddess ! Oh Goddess ! What should I do now ? What mistake did I do ? That I loved her more than my own life ? Or that I kept praying to Gods, stepping on the embers.. ..while my insides were still burning ? Tell me..u who have thrown the seeds of epilepsy at me! You who gave me a heart of excessive love. Tell me.. What do I do now? Tonight I must kill her. Get me some poison. You must not kill with poison. Strangle her while she's asleep. Ok. That's the just punishment. I shall finish off Kanthan tonight. Here, promise me. Tonight, I will kill Tamara. Before that, you must kill Kanthan. I promise. On my art, I promise. I'm going for my act. Felt like seeing you before that. Can I come? I'll see u from afar. No need. you sleep. Send Cheerma away. I'll be alone. -Dont worry. Dont put out the lamps. I'll return after my play. Please wait. Be careful when stepping onto the fire. I'll kill you ! you have been tricking me! Stop fooling around ! - Shut up ! I'll kill you ! you have been tricking me! Stop fooling around ! - Shut up ! I lost everything. Now I will kill you... Go ahead, kill! Would be an honor to die at a lord's hand. I lost my money, my Tamara.. You were cheating me, eh ? I see you have willpower now. Good. Now I truly respect you, lord ! All my maneuvering was for this moment to come. Hold onto this anger, and you will win ! Meaning... ? My efforts have not reached completion yet. Watch and see. Tonight you will unite with Tamara. How ? Perumalayan and Tamara were summoned to the palace. Then I'll never get her.. - you will. They will postpone their travel only if some tragedy happens. Kanthan is the best route for that. So.. tonight, lord, u must kill Kanthan. Me.. Kill.. Kanthan ? -Yes. That is your only route to achieve what you need. Kanthan will arrive with equipment to dress up for his role tonight. Before he enters the temple, you must do it. I'll be beside you. Am I capable of this ? - Yes you can. Keep up this courage. This anger you threw at me. That's all. Go. Tonight is your night ! Go ! You can.. for your Tamara ! I'm with you. Go ! Did you observe Perumalayan's face? He seems at peace. He said he would return back after his play. I was sad when he asked me to let you leave tonight. Let me leave !? -Dont worry Cheerma. He was lonely for 10 days. Needs company. you may leave. I still dont trust Perumalayan Maybe he's impulsively stubborn and angry due to excessive love. Its ok. I prepared your bed. Go sleep, Tamara. What stupidities we imagine, eh ! If I die before you, will u cover me with that robe? What rubbish ! Just imagining it..lying dead covered in that robe. Do you know where I first met him ? When ? Once, he was badly burnt in his play. They carried him over to my house. Poor fellow ! He was burnt badly. I sang to him to soothe his pain. That song keeps coming to my lips tonight. Why are you upset with me ? Why this anger towards me? I waited so long to see you once. But you never came even once. Didn't the fragrant breeze and moonlight inform you of my heart's desire? Why are you upset with me ? Why this anger towards me? Kajal lit up his eyes, a young boy as he shifted his gaze to a mirror He drew a circle of turmeric around his eyes And they shone like lamps. In the swing in my golden dream your seat still remains empty. The sound of his footsteps, draw me to the door. I tiptoe silently in the shadows, waiting for him to call me. But I do not see a boat at the river crossing. It seems you decided not to ferry me. Paniya.. you.. Help ! He's been murdered ! Help ! He's killing ! That's the reason. I'm convinced of it. Oh stars in the sky.. I dare not tell you the reason I shall not spill her blood. Shall not land a scratch on her body, softer than a snowflake. She must die. I shall put out this lamp. I shall turn off this light. If my lantern goes out, I can rekindle it. But if I put out that beautiful 'lamp' there,I can never rekindle it ! If I pluck this silent rose flower, I cannot give it life again. Before the flower falls.. let me enjoy its beauty. One final time. Etta Why.. you haven't.. changed your costume.. Yes Did you pray today? Yes. Why ? If you want to beg forgiveness for your sins, pray now. What are you blabbering? - Pray. Fast. I cannot kill a life that is unprepared to die. Kill !? What happened to you ? Yes. you heard right. Pray for your sins. I have only love towards you. What mistake are you talking about? That's exactly why you will die. What are you doing? I'm scared. You're shivering.. - Stay quiet. My life.. the robe I gave you.. You gave to Kanthan. I haven't done that ! Swear on the goddess ! I didn't give him anything ! The Gods witnessed it. I saw my robe in his hands. I saw it ! But I never gave it to him ! I promise ! You may ask Kanthan. He has already agreed to it. No.. he wouldn't ! His tongue shall never wag again. Paniyan has made sure. So tell me. Oh Goddess ! Etta.. dont kill me.. Dont.. Dont.. Etta.. Tamara kutty! Tamara.. - Who is it ? Its me Cheerma. Open the door. Tamara! Lord Unni was killed. They say Kanthan did it. Lord Unni ? Killed Kanthan eh? No.. Kanthan killed. Lord Unni died ! So didn't he kill Kanthan ? It's all gone wrong ! - Where's Tamara? Killed her. I killed her. What madness you speak. Tamara ! Tamara ! Wait. You must know of her treachery, too. You demon you.. you're insane ! She cheated on me ! - What rubbish ! You will rot in hell ! - She was Kanthan's whore. Ask your husband. He knows it all. My husband ? - Yes, Paniyan opened my eyes to it all. My husband told Tamara cheated ?? - She even gave my robe to Kanthan. Paniyan opened my eyes to it. -May he get struck by lightning ! I'm the one who stole that robe. Without Tamara's knowledge. I did it on my husband's bidding. Your 'friend' Paniyan ! Paniyan was saying truth. - Lies ! It was all lies! They were lies.. to make u do this crime ! Paniya.. Tamara kutty.. never cheated.. She loved u too much.. Dont kill... Dont... Dont kill.. I shall not kill you. you dont even deserve the kindness of death. You must live on.. a piece of flesh without limbs.. Forgive this God, please. May you succeed. Now my position.. belongs to you.. My Goddess.. Dont, Perumalaya ! No ! Dont ! Perumalaya !
