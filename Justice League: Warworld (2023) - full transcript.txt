Orginal Sub By ViKramJS Come on, I'm good for it. Payday's Tuesday. Ha! You see that, Griz? Plugged it right through the middle! Almost got him. Whiskey. Don't get a lot of strangers passing through. Certainly not pretty ones like you. Uh, anyone tell you you're a pretty fine piece? Girl, are you hard of hearing or something? I heard. Go away. You just made the biggest and last mistake of your life. Argh! No one likes a back-shooter, Tom. Outside, now. I apologize for my men. They can be rough around the edges. But then again, so is the town. Perhaps you'd join me for a drink? I'll give you the good stuff. Those were some moves you had, downstairs. Never seen anyone fight like that. You're a wonder. How'd you get the face? By trusting the wrong people. It's a tale as old as time itself. Gold is discovered and everyone is happy. And then greed shows its ugly face and ruins everything. Those so-called honest townsfolk took over the bank, which had repossessed their land for delinquent interest charges. Which you did legal, I'm sure. Now, my judges, every one said we was in the right. But they stole back the gold they used to pay for their stakes, and this cannot stand. We're a civilized society, a land of laws. If this bunch gets their way, why then, where would we be? I'm guessing you're going to tell me. There's an opportunity for you here. Help me fight for law and order. Help me-- Hyah! Hyah! Whoa! We don't want no trouble. Heading to the depot for a fresh start. Huh? Pa! No! Ma! Do it. Shoot that damn woman. Kill her! Open the gate! Argh! Argh! They killed them both. I know it's hard. Now you've got to be brave. I told 'em they should sneak off at night, but they didn't want to leave behind what little they had. Now they got less. Bat Lash, you damn fool! Why you making trouble with Hex's men? Because sometimes trouble's got to be made, Sheriff. What do you care? You don't ranch, farm, or dig gold. You don't have a dog in this fight. And why are you mixing in this? I'm not. Just passing through. Supplies would be appreciated. Does it look like we got extra stuff? At least give us your name before you ride off. They're coming again! Got a present for all you stubborn folk. I hope it sends you to hell. Shoot the wheels. Hyah! Oh, my God. She's an angel. That's why she's not hurt. Come to save us all. - Are you okay? - Okay? How are you not axle grease? I've had a think, and it may just be easier to kill you all. Eat lead. What the hell are you? Well, you certainly kicked that hornet's nest in the face. Now Hex will kill us all. He was gonna do that anyway. She saved us. Saved us? We're starving and dying of thirst here! I passed a storehouse on my way in. Plenty of supplies there. Great idea! Go ask Mr. Hex if'n you could load a wagon or two of his stuff after blowing him up! Not a bad idea. The supplies, I mean. Need a distraction, though. On occasion, I can be distracting. My mistake was showing mercy. I took half measures. No more. You got something to say? Well, sir, that outside, was a goat rope. Oh, it sure was. And you boys think you could make better decisions than me? That's right. I ever tell you about this timepiece? My great grandfather carried it through the Revolutionary War. My grandpappy, through the War of 1812. My pa had it during the Mexican-American War. And I took it through the war between the states. Had to hide it for a year from the Yankee Guards after I was captured at Shiloh. Uncomfortable, but still keeps the time. We don't give a damn about your grandpappy's watch! Oh... But you very much should. You see, my family has always settled their disputes with this watch. Now, when the chimes stop, make your move. Been meaning to fix that. I'll load up. Need five minutes. I was wondering when you'd show up. Throwing your lot in with a bunch of thieves doesn't match your code now, does it? And realizing that mistake, here you are. Looks like. Maybe we could strike a deal. But of course, you'd have to convince me. And I'm going to need both types of convincing. You think you can handle being physical with me? We hijack the train at Sweetwater, and load the nitro. We detonate it by the barricade. It'll vaporize everyone inside any minute now. Hyah! I got to say, you're real handy to have around. You trust me? Damn straight, I do. Get everyone out of the barricade. I'm gonna end this once and for all. Hyah! Argh! Hurry up, let's get out of here! Are you crazy? You go out there, you'll get these kids shot. Sheriff, we've got to leave. The angel's coming back, and she's coming back angry. I'm putting in for hazard pay. Look! Since there's, uh, nothing left to fight over, you could stay. With us. Nothing's over until I say. Ahhh! Would you have stayed? Welcome to my home. Welcome to Shamballah. Ugly one, aren't you? And the prisoners? To the mines. Their sword arms will be put to work swinging picks. Until the next mercenary arrives. We should have killed Deimos when we had the chance. I understand your ire, friend. But we cannot change the past, only ensure the same mistakes are not made in the future. Gather those that are able. We'll strike back, finish Deimos once and for all. Something funny, slave? Mercenary. There is a difference. Not from where I'm standing. You take an army to the wizard's, your queen might as well look for another king. You'll be dead before you see his face. And let me guess, for your freedom, you'll lead us to his throne room? No. For my freedom and a pile of gold. You give me those, I'll draw a map to his castle. Mercenary, remember? You can't possibly be considering this. How can we trust him? We can't. That's why he's coming with us. The hell I will. You want your coin? You want your freedom? Then you'll earn it like the rest of us. Or you can enjoy the darkness of the mines until you're old and gray. Is this necessary? Be grateful, it's only one chain. Machiste... For Skartaris! Mariah, scout ahead. It's high time we make camp. It's best to wait for night. Night? The darkness. You know as well as I, the sun shines forever on Skartaris. Yes. Where did you say you were from, mercenary? I... It matters not. You come to kill a king with a mercenary horde, wearing a strange helmet, and yet you don't know where you're from. I am your prisoner, not your gossiping harlot. There's a wooded glade, an arrow's shot away. Lead on. Mercenary. How long now? Across the Desert of Dreams, where men see visions that are more than visions. Then a short ride through the Dragon Sea. What can you tell us about this wizard? His fortress? Not much. Not... Why are you here, then? I told you, I could take you to his castle. Beyond that, you're the ones intent on dying. You fear his magic. I don't fear much of anything. Besides, I don't believe in magic. What do you believe in? Steel. Gold. The evil in the hearts of all men. Then you keep poor company. My king is a good man. Do you think so? Because he fights for truth and justice? No. All men are evil. He knows as well as I, the darkness that resides in our souls. Then it is up to us to stand up to the darkness. I've seen a jester slit the throat of his own king. Men made of ice steal from the poor, and women more cat than woman manipulate the just. And no one could stop them. Because evil is as unstoppable as the rain. That's why we fight for those that can't. A good man knows that the darkness will always be there, but stands against it anyway. Unlike mercenary scum like you, who care only about yourself. How did you come to be in his employ? He found me. He promised me riches if I would take your head. And you took it because death is nothing to a man with no life. You know nothing about me. Neither do you. What is it? To the trees! Argon and Rapasil. And you, you may have saved my life, but don't think you can escape. I'm not up here to escape. I'm waiting to see what those creatures were running from. Like hell. There. Baroth Mountain. Hold. What is it? I'm not sure. To shore! Argh! The sooner this cursed quest is over, the better. It's... It's... It's you, isn't it? Visions that are not visions. Climb! Here! Mariah. Something isn't right. What isn't right is we're taking too long. Every second we waste is one in which more could die. I'm going in, even if you're too scared. Machiste, no! It's hopeless. What good are we against such magic? Weren't you the one who said good men stood against evil, despite the odds? What is it? How did you know? I'm not sure. Run. Run! Give me the key. This is no time! Hurry! You can't. I can. You know the rule when running from a beast, be faster than the man you're with. Where is Warlord? Dead. Who are you? I don't know. There was a wreck, I think, and then Deimos found me. Enough chatter! Help us out of here. We can still kill the wizard, and save Skartaris. No. I want no part of your quest. Besides, there's no time to save you. But there is enough time to save myself. Ah-ah-ah. You don't want my magic wand to speak again, do you? So, you've returned. And your mission? Completed. The Warlord is dead. This was your plan all along. Of course. Attack Warlord, lose. Convince the Warlord to come here where I can kill him myself. I'll take my payment now. After you fulfill one small task for me. Do this last thing, and you will have your riches. Do it, coward. I can't... I won't... let you kill them. Ah-ha! Yes. Well, I'm not surprised. Oh, well, one less person I don't have to pay. I should let you kill each other. You! Time to die, wizard. My sentiments exactly. Ugh! Enough! How dare you! You pathetic mortals think that I, the great Deimos, would fall so easily? I am more than mere flesh and blood. I am magic incarnate. I am the ruler of Skartaris. I am the master of this realm. I am your death! Can you fight? Free me and find out. I know this. I've been trapped here for years. My name is Travis Morgan, and I am the Warlord. Deimos! I will have my revenge, Warlord. My Lord, where is Machiste? I'm sorry, Mariah. It's over now. We can return home. I could use more warriors like you. Come back with us. No. I need... To find a way back. Yes. But to where? Home. Come with us. Morgan... No. This is my home, my people. And I am their king. I need to be here to protect them from Deimos. Good luck. Sir? Agent Kent. Main office sent me. Ah, the new partner. I'm... Agent Faraday. I know. Purple Heart in Iwo Jima. Founder of the Central Bureau of Intelligence. Lead agent during the Janus Directive incident. Yeah, I know the resume, son. I lived it. They really threw you in the deep end with your first assignment, huh? What did they tell you about this? At 0700 hours, strange lights were seen over the town of Grover's Mill. Six witnesses claim they saw something fall from the sky. I'm thinking it's the Russians, sir. Another Sputnik. It came from space, all right. But think... farther. We've been dispatched here on behest of Majestic-12, a program that investigates UFO sightings. This might just qualify. It's up to us to interrogate the witnesses and find out what happened. Now's the time to prove yourself. Are you ready to uphold truth, justice, and the American way, no matter what? Yes, sir. No matter what. Then get ready to meet the peanut gallery. Ho there, Officer... Officer Wayne, highway patrol. Witnesses are inside. Excellent. Officer Wayne, my partner, Agent Kent. Do I know you? Let's get started. After you, Officer. Officer? Officer Wayne? Yes, apologies. I was... Never mind. Strange fellow. You all right there, son? Just dandy, sir. -Oh, thank God... -We've been here an hour. -...finally an authority. -Is it safe to go out there? Gentlemen, ladies, please. I'm Agent Kent. And he's here to ask us about the little green men. This is no joke! I know what I saw. We all saw it, lady. How long is this going to take? As long as it needs to, sir. It takes as long as it takes. For Uncle Sam and his United States, man. Well, I am happy to stay as long as the agent needs. I'm not. I've got a tanker in a snow drift and a route to keep. But we know you hit the snowbank. The pileup's why we saw the blasted thing. Please, everyone... You got a problem? Well, you could have been driving more carefully, is all. Lot of nerve you got! The American government appreciates your cooperation in this matter. Isn't that right, Agent Kent? Uh, yes. Please take a seat. Names and occupations, beginning with... Potter. Long-haul trucker. Mr. and Mrs. Lang. As of last Tuesday. We're on our honeymoon. Snapper Carr. Temporary weekend manager! You're not going to call the owner, are you? I really need this gig to work out. Burroughs Ginsburg Kerouac. Occupation, drifter! All right, Mr. free spirit, want to tell my partner what you saw? I was hitching down Highway 5. I politely step onto the shoulder so people can see me. Ha! That loon jumps out, I brake, and suddenly I'm in a snowbank with two cars on my bumper. That's when we hear it. It was shrill and whistling like a scream. Made your teeth vibrate. We look up, and. Agent, I swear, overhead was a flying saucer, like right out of the movies! - Then-- - Bam! It hits something in the distance. And then... And then... And then? This light starts coming from where it crashed, and it's not right. I've never seen a light like that. I never want to see that again. The thing slammed into the old barn at the end of the road. When we get there, there's footprints around it. We figure, hey, someone's hurt. We split up to look. I walk around back, and that's when I see it. We saw it! My hand to God, it was an alien running out of that barn. Ask that girl if you don't believe us. She saw it, too. Name and occupation, ma'am. I'm sorry. Um... You're asking? Oh, Ms. Prince. I'm a secretary. Mainly a typist. I... I was on my way to work when it all happened. I... I think... It's all fuzzy. I... I remember lights in the sky, but I was alone. I'm sorry. I must be in shock from the accident. I don't remember anything until Officer Wayne brought us here. - I'm... I'm sorry. - Psst. I didn't say this before because I didn't want everyone to hear. I was at the counter when that officer walks in with the lot of them. Says to wait for the authorities, but I didn't call the cops, and there's no phone at the old mill's barn. So, how did he show up so fast? Agent, we all followed that alien's footprints. But when we got back to the barn, I counted. There were five sets of tracks going into the woods, and six coming back. Are you saying the alien might still be in this area? I'm saying the alien... might be in this room. It could've changed its shape. Look like one of us. Project images into your mind. Confuse you. Anyone acting odd may not be who they say they are, man. If I were you, I'd look to anyone who seems different. Foreign. Strange. Weird. Un-American. Not like you and me. And when you find them, you got to take care of them right away. Or else you'll give them a foothold into your mind! I think it's her. That cop showed up out of nowhere. Are you gonna protect us? Will you do your job? Agent Kent, answer the question. Yes. I... I mean, no. I mean, I'm... Sir, I'm just trying to get information, okay? And would you turn that damn jukebox off? But it is off. Uh, excuse me. The music. We hear it too. I'm sorry. I have to ask you to go back with the other witnesses. No. Listen to us. What? Wait, what... What did you... What was that? Those images... What images? It's like we said! It's them! Sending visions into your brain. They're the aliens! I don't know what's going on, but-- Don't take a step further! Kent, back away from them. Back away? Kill them! We're not safe till they're gone! The music. It's coming from the car. Damn it, if you don't act, I will. How did you do that? I... I don't know. Your neck! Well, hey, looks like the alien was me. He's not human. Holy shit! None of them are human! Kent, run! How did you... I don't know. But this feels familiar. Huh. We have to get out of here. Get in. What is going on? An alien invasion. But what about us? The music, those images, they felt like-- Memories. They felt like memories. That's impossible. Whatever is going on, we need to get out. Argh! Glove compartment. Flare gun. Oil tankers have an exhaust port, which keeps the gas from sparking an explosion. Damage that, expose it to heat, and you turn the truck into a bomb. How do you know all this? I don't know. I just do. We got one shot. Make it good. Ha-ha! Yes! What the hell is that? Kent! Thank God, you got out. Faraday? I knew you'd come. Smart kid like you put it together. It started with the UFO, and here he is... the leader, the alien head honcho. That one doesn't look anything like the others. How do you know? Look at it! Even if it's not with them, it doesn't belong here. You have to kill it. It's the only way to stop their invasion. And after you do, we'll put these two down. What? No! They're not aliens. The minute they touched you, you started seeing things. They infected you with their alien powers. How else could you hit that creature across the room? Tell me I'm wrong! Tell me! You saw those people transform. We can't trust any of them. We have to kill them before they kill us. You said you wanted to uphold the American way, to prove yourself. This is the time! Do it! I don't know what's going on. I don't know why I've got these powers, or why I'm seeing those images. But I do know one thing. I am not going to murder people just because I'm scared. That's not the American way. Oh, my God. You're one of them. No. He's changing. Everything is. It was all an illusion. Not everything. We're real. And so is Faraday. And so is this. You flattened it with your chest. I started feeling stronger as soon as we came in here. Something about this light... - this... - Color. There was no color outside. None of us even noticed. And the alien leader, it looks like he's more of a prisoner than we are. He's fighting it. Whatever the machine is doing. He's being tortured. Help me get him out of there. We don't have all the facts here. -For all we know, this creature is-- -No. Torture is wrong. Period. You've got quite a grip there, Ms. Prince. I doubt it is "Ms. Prince." I think this identity is every bit the illusion that that evil Martian leader was. Ah, then it worked. You've come at last. Easy there, fella. Looks like you've been through a lot. On the contrary, Clark, I've put you, all three of you, through a lot. Bruce. Diana. Yes, those are your true names. And I know you well, for I've lived inside your minds for months now, helping create the illusions you've lived. Why? Not by choice. These machines usurped my telepathic power, and used it to enslave you and countless others. I don't understand any of this. Where on earth are we? Not Earth, War World. An immensely ancient planet-sized weapon that's powered by the hate and fear of its prisoners, I have been forced to create realities. part illusion, part technology, to wrench negative emotions from the poor souls trapped here. But you helped us. That music, drawing each of us here. Yes. After months of searching, I found a back door in the system. I called to you the only way I could. It took a dozen lifetimes. But you never gave up. I learned that from you, as well as courage and faith. It was time well spent. He's coming! You must hide. Find the zeta chamber. Escape while you still can. We'll bring you with us. You called us here to save you. At first, yes. I thought only of myself. Having lived in your minds, I-- Good night, ladies. Oh, you three are adorable. Oh. What? - They're not dead. - No. In fact, I think this one's just being born. Replacements for the ones I saw die. They're clones. Copies of people stolen over hundreds of years from various worlds, various realities. So, we're clones, too? No. Many of the prisoners are originals. Evidently, they produce superior hatred and terror. You'd make a great detective, Officer Wayne. I doubt it. There's too much I don't know, like how I even know how to work this database, or my real name, or who's watching us. Yes, I sense that, too. It must be that creature who attacked us. Hmm. This looks familiar. No escape for you, chump. Looks like you're gonna get some one-on-one quality time with the boss man. Oh, you can say that again. He ain't gonna be too happy that all of them illusions you've been pumping into the prisoners' minds are taking a commercial break. No fight left in you. Don't know if you even need these brain binders. Well, you wanted him. You got him. Eh, what's left of him. The last green Martian in the universe... This universe. What a disappointment you are. Millennia ago, she called to me, promised me power, and I came. I killed every last Larga here. But where was the power? Oh, boy, this story again. It never gets old. Now starts the key part. We were now one. The most devastating weapon in the universe, a planet killer. But where was the key? Spoiler alert, not here. Even without it, we are powerful, eternal... thanks to the unrelenting terror and violence of our treasured guests, But the key, she whispered to us. It took a dozen jumps to a dozen more realities before we found actual living Martians. Thousands of them in dozens of universes, and still no key. Then, our faithful dog here... Mercenary. Yeah. The last green Martian. You had no key. You knew of no key. You were useful only as a vision-caster. And now... ...even in that, you fail. There is but one small service you have yet to render the War World. That creature said you hated guns. Apparently he spoke the truth. Evidently, I'm very particular about how I dress. As I must be, too. I like it. Me, too. Clark! It's you! I don't know why I didn't see it before. I... I'm sorry. I still don't remember. But you're just a baby. Much too young to be my Clark. There are other differences, too. I see that now. Then you're starting to remember. I remember this. I remember... Superman. Other than that, just flashes of a life. I remember this room. The zeta chamber. Can you take us there? Yes. Louder... ...J'onn J'onzz. All of War World must hear your cries. Please, don't! And know that there is no hope for them, either. On your feet. It's not as good if we can't see your face. He's gonna finish you off, now. I'm gonna let you get one good shot in. Go out in a blaze of glory. Make it count. I could have just punched him. I wanted to see if I was right about what those things were for. I was. Yes, this is how I arrived here. I was bound... with this. It's hard to believe a rope could hold someone as strong as you. I don't think it's an ordinary rope. These controls are surprisingly intuitive. Where will it take us? Virtually anywhere we want to go. Prisoners of War World, Mongul speaks. Observe this being. He is stronger than you. He is wiser than you. Watch him die at our hands. And know, there is no hope. If we want to leave, this is the time. Understand, there's an army of warriors between us and him. I'm strangely comfortable with those odds. I'd say we've been in situations like this before. I was just gonna send you guys, and then go back and save him. So ends the very last green Martian. Whoa, that's it? I thought you were gonna say a little more. Because you are useful to us, Lobo, we give you a measure of freedom, - but do not-- - Like... we thought this ugly green Martian would give us the key to War World so we could actually fire the damn thing instead of just sitting on our ass for 10,000 years. Whoa! Uh, just yanking your chain a little. I'm all about breaking the awkward tension. Your screams will inspire our workers for decades, fool. Oh, come on, boss man. I didn't mean nothing. I just thought we needed to stop and smell the flowers for once. You know, slow things down. Why? Lord Mongul, there's a disturbance on level 12, citadel ring. Another tedious rebellion. Send an enforcement detail to all levels. Reports of a security division being overwhelmed on level ten. Close battle gates and scramble insurrection units. Showing malfunction on level eight battle gate. Malfunction? It's been torn out of its tracks. All communications lost on level four. Lower defensive bulkheads. - Come. - -Additional breaches on levels six and seven. Security divisions are being overrun. Power outage on level two. Defensive bulkheads raised by outside force. Yeah, that'd be Wonder Woman or Superman. But not Batman. That would screw up his lower back. I had you kill them. Kill them? I thought you said "Free them." Oh, well, honest mistake. Could happen to anybody. But I think it's great we're finally talking. Treachery. I know, right? You'd think you could trust a paid killer, and not expect he'd totally try to kill you and take over the most badass weapon in the universe. But, oh, well! Yeah! Arm yourselves. There he is. - At the foot of the leader. - On it. Kill them. You die now. Yeah! Don't take no shit from those Martians! You can't kill us. We are linked... War World and Mongul. We shall see. What are you doing? He's still breathing! Frag him! You owe me that Martian. I put in that back door. I freed you! And who do you think planted this idea in your mind? The entire planet is coming through that door. We can't hold them off for long. Come with us. I warned you to escape while you could, Wonder Woman. Start. The legend you heard was true, Mongul. The Largas did indeed hide the key among the Martians. Mars, locked in an eternal civil war... ...knowing we would never work together, the Largas secretly hid half the key in the DNA of the white Martians. The other half in the green. Neither side knew. No. War World is ours. Frag you! It's mine! Until only one Martian of either race survived. I am the last of my kind. Eventually, you would exterminate these whites as well. And then you would know. War World is the universe's ultimate weapon. You will never wield it. J'onn, what are you doing? What must be done, Superman. I don't like the look of this. A weapon of such horror must not be allowed to roam the multiverse causing endless death and destruction. Someday, it may fall into worse hands even than Mongul's. He set War World to self-destruct. J'onn, you can't. They're all prisoners... the people of Skartaris, even the clones. So I thought when I arrived. But I have spent time in their minds. War World's algorithm simply gives them what they think they want, then leads them deeper into their hatred and terror. You will fail. There is not fear or rage enough on all War World to do what you plan. You are right. But the richest vein remains untapped. The zeta chamber! There's no time. The three of you are needed. You will come with me. Now. A handful of lives on a single planet... that is nothing compared to the crisis that is to come. The absolute annihilation of everything, everywhere.
