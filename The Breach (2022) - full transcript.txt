Come on, guys! [group chattering and laughing] Advertise your product or brand here contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today [eerie music] [items rustling] - It was on the end of the table. Ha-ha! - Dad? [group laughing and chattering] - [Man] That's fucking crazy. - Guys, there's something down in the water. - What are you talking about? - The boat. - I don't see anything. - I don't know. I think it's empty. - Show me where. - I don't know. I just saw it come down the river. - I don't know. Come on, let's go, let's go look. - Where is everybody going? - Julie, what are you doing? - Wait for me. - Wait, Jess. [intense music] [group screams and gasps] - Shit, oh my god! [hard rock music] [hard rock music continues] [hard rock music continues] [hard rock music continues] [whooshing] [eerie music] [birds chirping] [vehicle approaching] [indistinct chattering] [door opens and closes] - Hey, Connie. - Hey. - What are we looking at? - It's hard to tell, boss. You're gonna have to take a look for yourself. Amy Lafoy spotted it first. She brought the whole dang family over. It might be a while till anybody gets any sleep. - Look like a local to you? - I don't know how you would tell. You ever seen anything like this, boss? - Ah... You call the coroner service yet? - Mm-hmm. - Carl Talson's gonna want take a look at this. - Carl's in Ottawa until the end of the month. Jacob's on his way. - [whistles softly] Yeah, he'd be the guy. [vehicle approaching] [door opens] Jacob. - Hawkins. Chief of Lone Crow. - That's a hell of a car. - Heard you're heading down south to the big city, man. - Yep. Just one week left. - Well, I'm surprised it took you this long. How's Meg doing with it? - Haven't spoken to Meg in a little bit. - A little bit, like what's that? Less than a lot but more than not enough? So, what do you got for me? [eerie music] - John Doe in a canoe. [stretcher squeaking] - Bad? - Words wouldn't do it justice. [eerie music continues] [switch clicks] [Jacob exhales] [light squeaking] - Okay. Let's see what we got here. [intense music] [John coughing] Holy shit. - Yeah. [eerie music] - Where'd the bones go? [John clears throat] - Is there any way, you know, animals could have done this or? [tool clinks] - Animals? There'd be bone fragments and shrapnel and... Where did you find this? [John exhales] It wasn't animals. [flesh squishing] And bugs would leave cocoon sacks and webs. This, this guy's insides have been shredded. Look at this. [switch clicks] What does that look like? - Is that an extra fucking finger? [eerie music] - It looks like your boy here was disfigured. That makes things very lucky for you. - Yeah, it'll speed things up by a few clicks. - Jake, what are the... [suspenseful music] [flesh squishing] [switch clicks] [eerie music] [plane whirring] [clock ticking] - [Announcer On Radio] Well then, it will be sticky with a high Tuesday near... - [sighs] Put this somewhere for me, would you? - Okay. Ah, why? - Because it creeps me out. I don't know. Nothing definitive in the cause of death. Jake was headed up to Thunder Bay with some tissue samples, but bit of a lucky break, actually. Our John Doe- - Cole Parsons. It's the dead guy's name. [bag crinkling] [eerie music] Lon Yazi was checking his trap-line out before dawn. He found this. It's Dr. Cole Parsons. He's some kind of physics genius with a lab at the University of Ozark. It's in Oklahoma. - What's he doing here? - He leased a place up at Lynx Creek about 15 months ago. - Lynx Creek is in the middle of nowhere. I mean there's, there's nothing up there but bush. - And a house, a big one according to the letter of agreement, He, ah, chartered a boat to take him up there, Hawk. - Local outfit? - Hmm. Meg Fullbright. - [breathes uneasily] Right. [papers shuffling] [bag zips] [insects chirping] [vehicle approaching] [dogs barking and whining] [rifle clacking] [rifle firing] [can clattering] I always said you were a better shot than me. - Officer Hawkins. What law did I break? [John chuckles] - See you found another lost cause. - Yeah, we're a welcoming family here. Oh. [laughs and kisses] Hi. Lester, this is John Hawkins, Chief of Lone Crow. [John chuckles] For the time being anyway. - Yeah, I figured you might have heard about that. - A town this size, even the raccoons have heard by now. Transfer down south, huh? Finally making it out to the big city. Hey man. Sincere congratulations. - I'm actually here on business. You did a job a while back about a year ago. A guy named Cole Parsons. - Yeah, scientist dude. What about him? - Turned up dead this morning. - Fuck. [kisses] What happened to him? - Ah, I can't really say yet. - Would you tell me if you could? - What do you remember about him? - Seemed like a decent guy, he was kind of distant, needed to get up to Lynx Creek, and it was just him and a couple of big wooden crates. Equipment, lots of it. - What type of equipment? - His business, not mine. - You never thought to ask? - Says the guy who never bothered to tell me he was blowing outta town. - I gotta head up to, to Lynx Creek, do some poking around. I'm gonna need some transportation. And someone who, you know, knows their way around. [Meg chuckles] [keyboard clattering] [eerie music] [mouse clicking] Connie. - Yeah. - What do you know about this Amber Alert? - Parson's little girl? - Yeah. - As far as I know, she's still missing. The missing person's report was never closed. I'm waiting on a callback from the lead investigator. - And what about the parents? Were they cleared? - Yeah, it looks like it. Linda Parsons, that's the wife, she wasn't even in the state when it happened. And Dr. Parsons was so distraught they had to sedate him. - Huh. [eerie music] - So you're training dogs now? - Oh, it's just a hobby. Getting people in and out of the bush is still my job. - That's an interesting way of putting it. - Haven't changed a bit, Jake. - Are you sure about this, boss? - [sighs] Which part? - Any of it? - Just stay close to the phone. Okay? - Mm-hmm. [engine revving] [siren wailing] [soft guitar music] [soft guitar music continues] [heavy guitar music] - So I'm guessing this is as far as the road goes. - As far as any road goes. Took Parsons up in May when the water was really high and even then we barely scraped through. - A fishing boat? - There won't be any fishing on this trip, Jake. - How long until we get to the house you think? - Hour and change. We can camp here and take the river in the morning if it makes you feel better. - You got any floodlights? - Yep. And a tarp. - No, let's get there tonight. - Hey, what if someone's waiting for us, do you really wanna show up in the dark? - You're with Chief of Lone Crow, Jake. Don't worry about it. [soft guitar music] [motor buzzing] [crickets chirping] I swear I heard someone say this would take an hour. [motor buzzing] Hey Connie, what do you got? - I got a few things, boss. The first item is that bug, the wasp. The one you guys found on Parson's body. Yeah. It aint so dead. You think I should send it to the lab? [static white noise] - Yeah. I wouldn't make that a priority. Is that, is that everything? - Well, I haven't been able to locate the wife just yet, but I did talk to a sheriff's deputy who worked on the case. And according to him, Linda Parsons fell apart after her daughter disappeared. She had to spend three months in a psych ward. - No shame in that. - No, but evidently she blamed the disappearance on something her husband invented. [motor buzzing] - Come again. - Some kind of machine. He faxed over the deposition. [static white noise] [voice distorted] - Connie. What? - "That thing my husband built stole my little girl." [motor buzzing] [static white noise] Boss? Hawk, you still with me? [motor buzzing] - [Jacob] Good news? - Ah, my deputy calls about a bug. [whirring] You guys hear that? [chittering] Yeah. [switch clicks] [whirring and chittering continues] It's kind of like it's coming from everywhere. [insects buzzing] [whirring continues] [hand whacks] - Fuck! All my life, I'm like heroin to bugs. [insects buzz and chirp] - Meg, what was that? - Whatever it was, it's gone now. [motor buzzing] [water sloshing] The house is just up the path. There's a clearing in a hundred yards. - All right, you two deal with the boat. I'm gonna check this out on my own first. - I'm not gonna miss that about him. - I guess this is where I tell you, I told you so. - Not gonna miss you either, Jake. - Just stating the facts, Meg. - No, you're kicking me when I'm down. You can be a real smug fuck. You know that? - That's why you left me for Chief of Lone Crow, right? [Meg chuckles] I still think about us, Meg. [items rustling] - Let's keep it professional, huh? [wind whistling] [low humming] [eerie music] [footsteps approaching] - Jesus fucking Christ. Who builds a monstrosity like this this far north? - Ah, it, it looks different. - Different? What the fuck you mean? - I'm, I'm gonna go on inside and poke around. Hang tight. [insects buzzing] [door creaking] Hello? [door closes] Police. Anyone home? [eerie music continues] [floor creaking] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [squishing] [chittering and snarling] [door knob clattering] [low humming] [door creaking] [eerie music] [suspenseful music] [door creaking] [fist thuds] - Hawk! [door opens] - I mean, it's a big house. I looked around. I couldn't find any signs of life. - Should we, should we go back? [footsteps thudding] - Home sweet home. - Wow. [bag unzips] I do not remember it being this bad. [eerie music] [pattering and chittering] - Rats, maybe. Raccoons. - Yeah. Big ones. [machine whirring] [lights buzzing] - It's coming from the basement. [low humming] [footsteps receding] [door creaking] [door slams] [humming and whirring] - Hey, check this out. [machinery whirring] [static buzzing] Some kind of supercharger. - Geez. How much power does this joint need? - It depends on what you're getting up to, I guess. This looks like it could be the electrical. - And that one? There's something back here. [electricity humming] That's interesting. - [John] What? - Looks like it goes all the way up. - I think I know where this cable's going. There was a room that I couldn't get into before. [eerie music] I swear to God, this door was locked the last time I was here. [creepy music] - Huh. Dear, this is some weird shit. [distorted screaming] - What is all this? [papers rustling] What is it? [creepy music continues] [insect buzzing] - Ah, fuck! I just got stung, man. - You all right? - Get the fuck away from me, man! - Hey, you fucking watch yourself. - Jake, let me take a look. - I'm fine. Sorry, it's just every fucking bug is out for my blood tonight! And this is voodoo bullshit! [Jacob breathes heavily] - [Alex] What kind of scientist did you say that was? - I didn't, but since you asked, physics, particle physics, actually. [Alex scoffs] - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - What's wrong? - Do you remember that time Greg and Anna were arguing about Jiffy Peanut butter? - [laughs] Yeah. What does that have to do with this? - They couldn't decide whether it was Jiff or Jiffy, even though they'd been eating that peanut butter for like, I don't know, since the 1970s. - Okay, so? - The Mandela Effect, Connie, the Mandela Effect. Ever wonder why things haven't been the same in the world since 2008? It's these scientists. You know, ever since the day they started playing with particles and collapsing micro black holes, ah, nothing's been the same. Come on, think about it. Was it Jiff or was it Jiffy? - Huh. [phone ringing] Oh, hang on. - This is Connie. - [sighs] You know, who built a house this big all the way out here? - Up the Porcupine River? I don't know. I mean, the old Arnprior Railway did go up there. - Yeah, that crossed my mind too. Check with all the local fur traders, you know, see if they've ever heard of this place. Maybe the bush pilots, they could have flow over it, so. [static crackling] [snarling] - Boss? - Hello? Oh, Connie? [static crackling] Connie? [eerie music] [crickets chirping] [insects buzzing] [door opens and closes] [Jacob sighs] [John clears throat] - [sniffs] So, is this is how you pictured finishing your hitch as Chief of Lone Crow? - Ah, I thought I might be a little drunker, wearing a bear skin hat, maybe. - Yeah. It's not how I thought you'd do it either. What? First you steal my girl then you ditch her. Did a number on us both, man. - What's your problem, Jake? - I can ask you the same thing. - Yeah, except it'd be none of your fucking business. - That's exactly where you're wrong. - It stopped being your business the minute that Meg threw your sorry ass out, which was long before we were anything. So spare me the fucking bullshit, will ya? - It's a fucking great story, huh? I like how you're the hero and I'm the prick. - You are the prick, Jake. - Yeah, well, you ain't no hero, John. It's a fucking shame you just can't see what's right in front of your eyes. Trust me. I'm doing it for her sake, not yours. You're making the same mistake I did. - Hey. - Hey. - Are you okay? - Fine. - Are you sure? 'Cause your eye looks a little... - I don't need a doctor, so it's okay. - Okay. [eerie music] [crickets chirping] [bag unzips] [Meg sighs] [suspenseful music] [footsteps pattering] Dude. [sighs] What the fuck? - Sorry, I just thought that maybe we might wanna all bunk in the same room together. - Why? - As a precaution. One of us keep watch. Maybe. - You want a roommate, try Jake. [door slams] [John exhales] [eerie music] [crickets chirping] [machinery whirring] [circuit clanking] [wind whistling] [insects buzzing] [floor creaking] [suspenseful music] [gun clacks] [gun clicks] [door creaking] - Hi. [gun clicks] Can't sleep. [John exhales] Something happened to this house since I last saw it. - What do you mean? - It's not the same. It's changed. It's gotten like older or something. - I'm not sure I follow. [Meg sighs] - All those cables. You know, and, and the air in here is like, like metallic or something. Oh, yeah, maybe it's just my imagination. I've spent weeks alone in the bush. This house? No fucking way. [eerie music] [whooshing] [ladder whirring] [ladder thuds] You never even asked if I'd come with you. [John chuckles] - Would you have said yes? - Would you have stayed? - Would you have asked me to? - Would it have mattered if I did? - Oh, is that really a fair question? [soft guitar music] - It feels like we're playing chicken. See who's gonna say the wrong thing first. - Would you rather if we didn't say anything at all? - Would that be easier for you? - Wait, don't go, don't go. [John sighs] [soft guitar music continues] [Meg moans] [Jacob moaning] [door creaking] [suspenseful music] [wind whistling] [creepy music] [chittering and whirring] [blankets rustling] - What? - That sound. [switch clicks] The power's out. - What the fuck is that? Jake? He must have gone outside for a leak or something. [John sighs] - [breathes uneasily] Who are you? - Okay. [suspenseful music] Everyone just stay calm. - I'm not, I'm calm. Where is my husband? - Your, your husband? Are you Linda Parsons? [pump clacks] - Don't move. - My name is John Hawkins. I'm the chief of the Lone Crow Police Department. - What are you doing here? - I could ask the same thing to you. - I'm here to find my husband. - Mrs. Parsons, Linda. A man's body was found just outside Lone Crow. - Way south, down river. - That's why we're here. I'm, I'm truly sorry. [eerie music] [lantern clacks] - Can I get you anything? - Some heat would help. - The, ah, generator is out. - Let me see if I can get it working. [switch clicks] - Be careful. - [Linda] The power was on when I got here. - [John] When was that? You got back here? - Yesterday. I think. - You're not sure? - What happened to him? - We're hoping, um, some tests are gonna clarify that. - Hoping? - Natural causes has been ruled out. That's pretty much all I can tell you right now. [Linda breathes uneasily] [eerie music] [metal parts clattering] [chittering] Meg, are you okay down there? - Yeah! I, I can't get it to work. [intense music] - You said you came up here looking for your husband. How did you know where he was? Did he contact you? - No, I, I finally tracked down the rental agency, the house. So I chartered a float plane. - The pilot? - He didn't stay. I didn't want him to. - So you stayed here alone last night? - My husband had been here, the power was on, so I waited. And finally I went out searching. - You just got back now? - Yes. - Okay. Okay. [creepy music] The body was significantly damaged, but it was your husband's ID. - So you don't know. Not for certain. You don't know it's him. - Ah, your husband's hand. [clattering outside] - What is it? - When you got here, you're sure there was no one else outside? - No, not that I saw. - What's going on? - Stay here. Jacob? [suspenseful music] [crickets chirping] [birds squawking] Fucking guy. [machine buzzing and whirring] [glass clinking] - The fuck? [door closes] [whirring continues] - Isabelle. [breathes uneasily] [machinery whirring and clattering] - Hey! Get out! - Jake! Hey, Jake! Okay, okay. [machine clanking] [Jacob breathes heavily] - Where am I? Where am I? [eerie music] - Did you, did you turn that thing on? - No, of course not. - [scoffs] We're not dicking around here, man. What the fuck was that? - I don't know. I don't know. - How did you get up there? - I was asleep, then the next thing you know, I'm in that fucking attic. Just don't touch me. Okay? I need to go lie down. [footsteps receding] - Hey. Hey. Where's Linda? - [sighs] I think she's still up there. [footsteps receding] [Meg sighs] You okay? - No, no, I'm not okay. [eerie music] [creepy music] - [breathes uneasily] Where did you get this? - I found it downstairs. [Linda gasping] [Linda sobbing] - Your daughter. It was here? [Laura whimpering] [Meg breathes uneasily] [creepy music continues] [machine whirring and buzzing] [John coughing] [machine pulsing] [John breathes uneasily] You called her name earlier. You said "Isabelle." - [whimpers] When you lose a child, you see them in everything. [eerie music] This machine took her. - What exactly does it do? - Have you heard of a particle collider? It uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles to incredible speeds. - How dangerous is it? - To anyone that goes inside, I, I... - And the rest of us? [Linda whimpering] [Meg sighs] - [John] Linda! [footsteps approaching] - This room was locked when I checked it. Where did you find the key? - I didn't, it was open. What can you tell me about all this? - [breathes uneasily] I worked with Cole for over 10 years and I can tell you that this is not his work. - You're sure? Okay, all right, if this is not his work, then what the hell is it? - He may have had assistance. Someone he was secretly communicating with. [John exhales] I don't know why he wouldn't share it with me. I, I could sometimes hear them talking late at night. - All right. Well, there might be answers on his computer if we could access the files. - Are you asking for my permission? - I'm asking you for the password. - Well then I wish I could help you. [items clattering] [crows cawing] - Look, I know this is difficult for you, but if I'm gonna find out what happened to your husband... [eerie music] Linda? Linda? [Linda breathes rapidly] [door opens] [Linda breathes uneasily] - Hello, Tinker Bell. [Linda whimpering] [hand whacks] [both gasp] I deserve that. - We had very good reason to believe that you were dead, Mr. Parsons. [Cole laughs] A canoe ran ashore. There was a body inside. It was badly mutilated. - Jeepers. That's terrible. [whooshing] [Jacob breathes uneasily] [eerie music] [Jacob whimpering] [Jacob gasps and groans] - Walk me back a little bit. Didn't you hire Miss Fullbright, chartered a boat? - Who's boat? - Mine. - Oh yes. Ah, it had just been so long, I'd forgotten. - Did you forget about me too? - What? No. Linda, I could never forget about you. Never. I just needed to get away for a while. - A while? It's been over a year. - Feels like forever. [bandage peeling] [Jacob groans and breathes uneasily] [eerie music] [eyeball squishing] [Jacob gasping] [intense music] [knock on door] - Jake? - Hey. - Hey. - Could you get me some water? But not from the tap. I don't trust the water here. - Sure, anything you want. How are you doing? - Hmm, better, thanks. [door creaking] [Jacob whimpering] [door closes] [eerie music] - Now that you're obviously alive, I'm faced with a completely different question. What's a dead body doing with your backpack? Okay. Why not tell me about the machine in your attic? - Hmm, oh, it's something I've been working very hard on. - Is it something someone might wanna steal from you? - Oh, I can't imagine. - What would you do if they did? [crows cawing] - Hawk, it's Connie again. I need you to call me back as soon as you can. There's been, ah, developments. [receiver clacks] [wasp buzzing and pattering] [computer dings] [gasps] Oh! What is it, Alex? - Yeah, I was thinking about that physicist you mentioned. - Yeah. - And I, I don't wanna scare you. - Well, I don't scare easy. You should know that by now. - Yeah, well, have you ever heard the name Cole Parsons? - What about him? - Yeah, he was some hotshot at CERN before he was fired. - I don't, what's CERN? - CERN, the largest particle physics lab in the world, Connie. And do you know what they do there? Black magic rituals. I mean there's a hundred YouTube videos if you wanna check it out. And frankly, I'm a little surprised you haven't. - Oh, okay. But why would they be- - Listen to me, people from all over the world are hearing this crazy, weird humming noise and they can't explain it, and why? Because there is no explanation for it. They are opening the gates to hell here. And Parsons, I'm telling you Parsons, he's at the center of it. - I have work to do, Alex. - Oh, come on. Connie, please don't let them- [computer dings] [wasps buzzing] [trees creaking] - Jesus. [branch cracks] [eerie music] - Did you really think I wouldn't find you? Cole, I've seen the room upstairs. That thing in the attic. Her doll. Jesus, Cole, you brought her doll here. Why? - I needed her. - Talk to me. Please. I came because I need to know what happened. To both of you. [Cole breathes uneasily] [crows cawing] - Not now. Go lie down. [leaves rustling] [trees creaking] [intense music] [John exhaling] - [Meg] John? [John breathes uneasily] [Linda breathes uneasily] [knocks on door] [door opens and creaks] [Jacob whimpering] - Oh God. Can you hear me? [Jacob convulsing] Oh my God. [suspenseful music] [intense music] [Jacob whimpering] Jacob, let go of me. [Jacob choking and coughing] - I was looking to get a signal. I gotta fill Connie in then... And then I gotta figure out what the hell to do next. - What we're gonna do next is we're gonna get Jake the hell outta here, sooner the better. - Chief. - Jacob. Jake. - Jake, are you okay? - You need to look at his hand. His hand. [suspenseful music] [Meg gasping] - Holy shit. - We have to get him out of here. Fast. - We need to call in a plane, something. - I still can't get any signal. - [breathes heavily] We have a boat, I can, um, I'll go down river, try to get service. - Go now, go. - Okay. What the fuck is happening to him? - I'm not a medical doctor. - No, but you know more than you're letting on. - He was... - What? - He was in the machine when it activated, I don't think anyone knows what effect that could have on molecular structure. - Not even your husband? - No. No, he could, he couldn't have known. He, ah, he would never set out to hurt her. [suspenseful music] - What did you just say? - He loved her more than anything. He didn't know, he... - Look at me. [Linda sighs] - He couldn't have known. - Is this what happened to your daughter? - No! I swear to God. [cries] You have to believe me. - Jesus, fuck. [door opens and closes] [Meg panting] - The boat. I, I swear I brought it up on shore last night. - Things do go missing around here. - You do something to our boat? - No. - Well someone did. - It appears that way. - You fucking getting smart with me? - [Meg] You should check down at the camp. - What camp? - Down river, about a mile, mile and a half. - Yeah, I saw it on the way up here. [panting] It was right where I saw that thing last night. - All right, let's go check it out. But we gotta make it fast. - Wait, what about Jake? - We'll deal with him in a bit. Come on. - You are the breach. [suspenseful music] - What'd you say? Megan, what'd he say to you? - Just leave it. - What did you say? [fist whacks] - Christ, John! - Oh shit! [groans] - Man's had it coming since he got here. [body slams] Stay there! [handcuffs clattering] [Cole groaning] [handcuffs clacking] [Cole laughing] - What's so fucking funny? What'd he say to you? - I don't even know. There goes your ticket outta Lone Crow. - Well maybe it's just as well. Let's go. [Jake gasping] [suspenseful music] [upbeat ring tone] [voice distorted] - Jake, is that you? [static buzzing] Jake, can you hear me? [voice distorted] I can hardly hear you. Hang on. Jake. [Jake gurgles and groans] Tell Hawk we got the lab results back. The dead guy in the canoe is Cole Parsons. It's nothing new. It's just confirming what we already figured, but I need him to call me back. [eerie music] [Jacob groaning] - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. [Jacob whimpering] There, there. You are almost here. Shh. [suspenseful music] - Jesus. [gun clicks] [keyboard clattering] [error message buzzes] [suspenseful music] [keyboard clattering] [error message buzzing] [Linda chuckles] [keyboard clattering] [key clicks] [message beeping] [Linda sighs] [mouse clicks] [eerie music] [mouse clicking] [static crackling] - Hi, Tinker Bell. I knew you'd find me. I only hope it's not too late. [sighs] I did it, Linda. I touched the edge of reality. Let something touch me back. [breathes uneasily] I did something I shouldn't have done. [suspenseful music] - Oh! [coughing] [Meg gasps and coughs] [intense music] [flies buzzing] I experimented with others, but I got to see for myself. [Linda gasping] I have to leave now. Now before it kills me. No more secrets. Don't hate me, Linda. [Linda crying] [suspenseful music] - No. No. [whimpering] Please, no. Isabelle. [intense music] Isabelle! [Isabelle screaming] [Linda gasping] [Linda breathes heavily] [gasps] No. [Linda gasps] [intense music continues] [papers rustling] Oh! No! Ah! [papers tearing] [dramatic music] What did you do? [soft dramatic music] Is she here? No! No! Where is she? [Linda grunting] [intense music] [Meg panting] [Meg vomits and coughs] - Oh, Meg, I'm sorry, I'm sorry you had to see that. [Meg breathes heavily] - I'm pregnant. [crows cawing] [Meg breathes heavily] - Well, how long, how long have you known? [Meg sighs] Meg. - Let's just focus on one thing at a time, yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Okay. [Linda whimpering] [grate clattering] [papers rustling] [Linda breathes uneasily] [Linda groans] [pipe creaking] [Linda gasping] [step snaps] [body slams] [Linda whimpering] [Linda breathes uneasily] [Linda groaning] [leaves rustling] Shit. Where the hell is he? What is this guy? A physicist or a fucking magician? [lantern scraping] [can clinks] [objects scraping] [footsteps thudding] [footsteps receding] [suspenseful music] I think we, um, we gotta assume the worst here.
