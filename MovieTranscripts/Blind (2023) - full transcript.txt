A passenger left it in the cab So I use it sometimes. But... how did you know? Has a very familiar smell My ex-boss used to wear it. What happened to your eyesight? If you don't mind me asking. It was an accident. Both retinas got damaged. You must have been waiting for long... You look tired. Here, have some water. Thank you very much, very kind of you. Should I open it for you? No it's okay, I'll have it later. What was that? I've got some things lying in the boot. -That sounded like someone-- -Let me open the bottle Can you please driver a little slow Give it to me! I insist! Stop, stop it! Are you okay? Hello? Are you alright? What was that? The boot popped open, I was closing it Please sit inside. You put something inside, I felt it. No, it was nothing... Please sit, I'll be right there. Who are you calling? Ma'am are you alright? So let me get this straight... The driver had a person in the boot of his car? Yes. And you're sure of this? I mean, no offense but... You can't see so... Like I said before, I heard knocking from the boot of the car That's when he switched on the music and start driving fast and.... Sorry! David... What's happened? Sir, Bedi has called you.. It sounded urgent. Okay Ma'am, David will take your statement We'll look into it and get in touch You don't believe me? Of course I do. Don't worry, you'll hear from us soon. David, please take Miss Singh's statement. Absolutely sir. What do you want with me? Why are you doing this? Don't worry... I won't bite. Please... Let me go! Please You know... Shakespeare said... Hell is empty Because all the Devils are here. And I'm here to save you from them I won't tell anyone... Please! My mother always used to say that one day... someone will break you so much... that you'll become... Unbreakable! Shall we go again? A 27 year old girl with brown eyes and pink hair... A 27 year old girl with brown eyes and pink hair... Identified as Mia Wallace... left her house for a party on the 9th of January... and she hasn't returned as yet. This is the second girl to have gone missing in the last week. A report was filed this morning by the mother of the alleged missing girl... Who was last seen leaving the Alcatraz Club in Eastvale PI... in a taxi, around 10pm.. wearing a black top, and a silver skirt. Elsa... Time to go! Kevin! Get me the report on yesterdays robbery please. What am I supposed to do with her? Khanna, she claims to have information about Mia Wallace... so she's a potential eye witness. Eye Witness? Bedi sir, she's blind! How can she be an eye witness? You do half your work with your eyes closed... but somehow you figure things out... So, go and figure this out too! Get some work out of him too, Get some work out of him too, He's just sitting there and getting fat. and you just loving jerking me around, right? It's the best part of my day. Go take her statement and send her home, or am I asking for too much? Fine, I'll do it? Listen! Yeah? Go! What are you laughing at? Oh my God... Good morning! Morning Name? Gia Singh. Gia Singh I'm Prithvi Khanna, I'm the DI Would you like some water? No thank you, sir. I read your report last night Now you're claiming to have information about Mia Wallace? Yes, sir! But, how do you know it was Mia Wallace? How are you even sure that it's a person? Like I said before in my statement I heard a sound from the boot... The driver dismissed it saying there are some things in the boot The second time, I heard a knocking sound He turned on the music and started to drive fast... Immediately after the accident he got out of the car. As I was getting off the cab, I felt him put something in the boot. The weight felt like that of a person When I asked about it, he tried to force me back into the car. Okay... Thank you for coming in. If something comes up we'll call you. Okay? That's it? You already had this information. It's because I'm blind. No, not at all. If I could see, what would you ask me? The usual questions... Car number, driver description... He was 5'10" or 5'11"... Average build... Maybe around 35 to 40 years old. -Is that all? -You're 5'6" or 5'7" Also average build Around 45 years old How do you know this? It's not that difficult... I can tell the height by the angle of the voice Build by its reverberation And age through intuition. There are also certain things that one can't see Like the fact that you had Chinese food for breakfast. How do you know that? Soya Sauce It's normally used in Chinese food. This is so good. Can you also tell my future? No but seriously... seriously... This is.. This is wonderful. Let's talk some more. So you're convinced there was someone in the boot Yes, sir. But why Mia Wallace? Because I heard on the news... that Mia Wallace got into a taxi from club Alcatraz at around 10pm. The taxi picked me up from the Orphanage around 10:45pm The distance between club Alcatraz and the Orphanage is around 30 minutes. It's highly unlikely that two kidnappings happened in the same area on the same night That's why I believe it was Mia Wallace. Let's assume that you're right and Mia Wallace was in the boot... Let's assume that you're right and Mia Wallace was in the boot... Why did he offer you a lift? Why would he risk getting caught? He saw a Blind girl, alone, waiting for a taxi For him, it was a double win What threat can a Blind girl pose? That's why he wasn't worried about leaving you behind Exactly! He figured you wouldn't be able to identify him anyway... When I sat in the car he gave me a bottle of water. When I started asking questions, he tried to force me to drink it and that lead to the accident Forcing you to drink water? Why? Maybe he was trying to drug me Right... What else? Old Spice! He was wearing old spice And... When I tackled him outside the car I felt a watch on his right hand So he's probably left handed. People usually wear their watch on the weaker hand Agreed! Anything else? He was Indian! So basically, we are looking at a left-handed, Indian, taxi driver... who wears Old Spice... And has a potentially damaged car. Yes! We could check some garages too. Just give me 2 minutes. I'll be right back! Bedi Sir! I have a strong hunch about this sir But this is just a theory, we can't act based on a theory. The blind girl isn't in a position to make a positive ID of the victim We don't even know if there is a victim No description, no car number, nothing For all we know... a suitcase could have fallen out of the boot. Sir, he was forcing her to drink water... Why would he do that? -There has to be a reason. -Khanna! My wife forces me to drink water every day My wife forces me to drink water every day shall we go arrest her as well? Sir, she's your wife... She has to force you! Look, you want me to back this right? Please. Find the kidnapper, with substantial evidence I'll get you a promotion along with an arrest warrant. Deal? Are you serious? I suggest you start the paperwork. Thank you Show me, mate. Kobe for what? For why? Fake Kobe! Go get that! You know if you want to shine, You need to bring the skills yourself Go on! Go on! Hurry up and come back man, I'm not finished beating you yet! What the...? How did you make that? I'll be back in 2 minutes Ola (Hello). Any of you guys work around the Eastvale PI Carlos trabaja por ahi Now give me a subtitle. English please. Carlos usually works around there. Carlos! You work around Finnieston no? Yes, it is close to home so I start there every morning and hope to finish there every night But where life will take you... no one knows. Deep! -Indian? -No! Bangladeshi What's the time? Half three Fish curry? No One minute. Hello? What? I'll be there in 20 minutes. We got another witness Who? You're sure it was Mia Wallace? What do you think? How many pink haired girl are roaming around Glasgow in silver skirts? How many pink haired girl are roaming around Glasgow in silver skirts? I'm the cop here! Don't ask me questions Give me the answers. Did you see the drivers face? Or any other details? No, I was on the bridge But I saw the car... and it was definitely not a taxi So tell me what car was it then? Not sure... Never seen that one before But you're sure it wasn't a cab? Are you lying? Why would I lie? You look like you would. Okay Why didn't you say this earlier? Why didn't you call the cops? Like I said before... I saw him put the girl in the car... I thought maybe... He was taking her to the hospital Today, when I saw the poster, I understood what happened and came here Where did he put the girl? In the back seat. I was in the back seat He put her in the boot Got something to say? Now use your imagination I'm telling you It was a black car... and it was definitely not a taxi! He's here for the reward money What? What? No! Come on, I'm trying to help you I got it! No, I'm telling you it was definitely NOT A TAXI I have eyes! I can see and you still want to believe this blind girl? -Come on man! -Keep your voice down You're in a police station okay? Secondly, get out of here... We'll call you if we need to... Come on! Let's go! Take your bag please! This is ridiculous! This is ridiculous Goodbye! Stop dreaming Adrian What gives you the right to control my life?

I've been thinking... What if Nikhil is telling the truth? I don't trust that boy. He knows nothing! What was the need to call again? He admitted to lying about the back seat... Maybe he's telling the truth about the taxi? So? If we assume for a minute, that it wasn't a taxi...
